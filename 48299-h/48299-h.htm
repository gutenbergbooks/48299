<h1 id='t77'>PREFACE</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst few, if any, animals have more enemies
than the hare, none perhaps is better endowed
with instincts to outwit them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As that great mediæval hunter, the Master of
Game, said in 1402: “There is no man in this
world that would say that any hound can unravel
that which a hare has done, or that could find
her. For she will go the length of a bowshot or
more by one way, and ruse again by another and
then she will take her way by another side and
the same she shall do ten, twelve or twenty times,
then she will come into some hedge or thicket
and shall make semblance to abide there and
then will make crosswards ten or twelve times
and will make her ruses and then she will take
some false path and shall go thence a great way,
and such semblance she will make many times
before she goes to her seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shifts such as these, probably unrivalled in
their subtlety, are embodied in the incidents,
based on observation or record, which make up
the present story of the hare, a story for the
first time told at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagination has of necessity supplied much
of the description of a life spent under the stars;
but nothing alien to the hare’s habits and
character has been wittingly introduced, though
what the outlook on the world, what the
thoughts of this and the predatory creatures
entering into the drama are, must ever remain
a matter for speculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrative has been placed a century
back, chiefly because the more primitive days of
a bygone Cornwall allowed the inclusion of more
numerous fauna, and permitted the use of a
wilder setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For my aim has been to present a picture
instinct with the spirit of the wild, of the upland,
moor, and cliff of the Land’s End at a time when
the prey and the beast of prey roamed the night
fearless of snare and gin—and man rarely
intruded by day—under conditions, rapidly fading
into oblivion, which seem worthy of record before
they disappear for ever.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;margin-top:1.5em;font-size:1.6em;font-weight:bold;'>THE STORY OF A HARE</p>

<h1 class='nobreak'><a id='c01'></a>CHAPTER I</h1>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>EARLY TROUBLES</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span>
The Cornish Heights terminate near the Land’s
End in four wild hills of singular charm, though
of very modest altitude. Springing as they do
from a treeless tableland, they look quite like a
miniature mountain range, especially when seen
through rolling mists or capped by the rain-laden
clouds which, like birds coming weary
from the Atlantic, settle on their summits.
Man seldom intrudes there, though they offer a
peerless prospect over promontory and ocean.
The faint paths amongst ling and furze are not
his: they have been traced by the foxes that
kennel on this silent retreat, or by badgers going
to and from the deep sett on the northern
slope; for the desolate upland has long been
given over to the outlawed creature, and furnished
sanctuary to any wildling that sought it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To these hills, in the late winter of a year long
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
ago, there came a hare in search of a spot to
which she might safely commit her young. She
was hard to satisfy, rejecting for this reason or
for that a score of harbourages that competed
for her favour. One night she all but decided on
a bramble-patch near the top of <a id='caer'></a>Caer Bran;
the next she fancied first a heathery knoll on
Bartinney, then an abandoned mine-heap on
Sancreed Beacon; and at the last moment rejected
both for the western slope of <a id='chap'></a>Chapel Carn
Brea, partly on account of its uninterrupted
outlook, but more because it was less overrun
than the sister hills by the predatory creatures
that infested the countryside. All through the
month of March she had not seen a polecat
or even a stoat upon the hillside; only once had
she detected on it the trail of an enemy; so with
a feeling of security the timorous mother entrusted
her young to its keeping, laying them in
a tussock of coarse grass near a ruined chantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were pretty little things with wide-open
eyes, distinguishable by only the white star in the
forehead of the male and the greater restlessness
that he displayed. The tiny fellow, as if
eager to explore the world into which he had
just been born, was all agog to be out and
about in the afterglow, and had not his mother
checked him till the impulse passed, he would have
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
left the form and perhaps lost himself amongst
the furze. He constantly renewed his struggles
to have his way; but the moment he ceased, she
removed the restraining pad and caressed him
till, like his sister, he became drowsy and at length
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the stars shone bright, the hare rose,
stretched her stately limbs, covered the little
sleepers with the grass-blades, gathered herself
for a spring, and leapt to an outcropping rock.
On landing she leapt again and again and again,
in order to prevent any beast of prey from
following her tracks and discovering the form.
After taking these precautions she made for the
crest of the hill, and standing on the ruin, snuffed
the wind and scrutinised the waste. Presently,
assured that no enemy threatened, she set out
for the feeding-ground. At the foot of the long
slope she repeated her ruse of the leaps, and
passed through a hole in the wall that separated
the wild from the farm land, to which she had
been attracted by the tender herbage of the
young wheat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near midnight the leverets awoke and found
her gone; yet in their loneliness they uttered
neither plaint nor call, nor, strange to say,
attempted to leave the form, but nestled close
hour after hour awaiting her return. They gave
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
no heed to the wind, for its sighing meant
nothing to them; but at early dawn, though no
sound broke the silence, the cocked ears first of
one, then of the other, told they were all expectation
for some signal. Soon there came the
faint, low call which instinct whispered was their
mother’s, followed by the soft beat of the pads,
growing more and more distinct till with a
last bound the hare cleared the wide space
between the rock and the form, and at once
gave herself to the hungry, excited mites. Whilst
she suckled them, a lark rose and greeted the
day with notes so rapturous as to drown the
crowings of the cocks in the homesteads dotting
the plain. The leverets fed and fed till they were
satisfied, then settled down to rest against their
mother’s side, where presently the sun, risen
above Caer Bran, discovered them, and threw a
bright splash of warm light across their russet
coats.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lovely April morning. Towards
noon a big black cloud came up out of the west
bringing needed rain, whilst a rainbow arched
land and sea; and then the first call of the
<a id='cuck'></a>cuckoo rang out through the stillness. Chapel
Carn Brea faintly echoed “Cuckoo! Cuckoo!”
The joyous notes brought the housewife to
the door, checked the frolics of the wondering
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
lambs, made the field-mice sit up and listen and
the leverets prick their waking ears. The far-flung
message that told of kindly weather and
plenty for man and beast cheered every living
thing that heard it: it cheered even the hare
as she sat and watched over her young, full of
misgivings for their safety. Their helplessness,
still more her own powerlessness to defend them
against enemies, stirred her deepest feelings, and
made her mothering instinct so much stronger
than that of the vixen laid up with cubs in the
croft beyond the wheatfield. She was haunted by
the dread of being bereft of them; and incapable
of defence though she was, her fears kept her
ever alert and vigilant. She never slept. Even
when she drowsed her open, wakeful eyes saw
all that passed within their range—the farmer
faring to his work and hastening to his meals,
the cows driven to and from the fields, the
pigs wandering up and down the lane, the donkey
browsing on the furzy waste by the common with
the large pool, and the geese who, towards sunset,
waddled from it to the farmyard gate cackling to
be penned, as if apprehensive of being carried
off by the hill-foxes that came and sniffed at
their door when man was abed. She noted
too the ravens as they winged by on their way
to the cliffs, and the <a id='kite'></a>kites as they soared high
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
overhead; she watched with no little concern
the <a id='buzz'></a>buzzard whose shadow passed over her as
he searched the hillside before alighting on the
broken chancel of the ruin. His terrifying cat-like
mew caused the leverets to stir beneath her,
but she herself remained as motionless as the
furze; indeed, till the sun had set, she never
moved for fear of prying eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four days passed without disquieting incident,
but on the fifth the vixen<a id='vix'></a> paid a visit to the
hill and threw the hare into a fever of anxiety.
The daring marauder came at high noon, during
the farmer’s dinner-hour, when the land is forsaken
and the peace of the waste spreads to the
fields, enticing the nocturnal prowler to venture
forth in broad daylight in search of food. Thus
lured, the vixen, yielding to the importunities of
her hungry cubs, stole from her earth and, keeping
to the overgrown ditches, gained the boundary
wall without exposing herself to view. But the
instant her mask showed above the coping-stone
the hare espied her, and from that
moment followed every movement. She thought
that the fox knew of her presence and was in
search of her, as well as she might, for the hill
harboured no prey save herself and her young,
at least none worth the coming for. So while
the vixen searched the lower slopes the hare
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
watched with eyes starting from her head,
anxious to learn whether the murderous creature
would hit the line she had left at early dawn.
Once she crossed it without checking; she
flashed over it again near the Giant’s Bowl,
and then the hare knew that the trail would
not betray her; the hot sun had evaporated
every particle of what little scent she had left.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
The hunter moved at an unusually quick pace,
as if she had set herself the task of examining
the whole hillside during the short time that
man remained within doors. Now she threaded
the bushes, now she leapt them; once she was
lost to view in a patch of tall furze gorgeous
with blossom, but in a few seconds she reappeared
at the far end to continue the quest
in the open. At last near the black shadow
cast by a boulder she stopped, assumed a
listening attitude, then plunged her long nose
into a bush after a mouse, but apparently
without getting it, for she did not lick her
chops. Nothing disconcerted, however, on she
went again, ranging to and fro without a pause
till, half-way up the slope, she stood suddenly
still and looked towards the homestead as if
all at once alive to the risk she was running.
A glance satisfied her that man was still
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
indoors, and again she resumed the quest, if
possible with greater keenness than before.
Every stride now was taking her dangerously
nearer and nearer to the hare, but whilst she
was yet some five or six rods below the form
a sheep-dog barked, and in an instant she was
transformed from a lithe hunter into a craven
creature. Crouching, she fixed her gaze on the
dog expressing his delight at the reappearance
of his master, who stood in shirt-sleeves at the
open door. “Down, Shep.” At the sound of
the man’s voice the vixen sank into the herbage
as if turned to lead, and remained there motionless,
save in heaving flank and lolling tongue.
Presently the farmer withdrew; the vixen slunk
down the hill, carefully avoiding the exposed
places, climbed the wall, and vanished from
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much as the hare was relieved by this
retreat, she could not regain her peace of
mind; for the visit left her with the fear that
the creature would return at nightfall and
renew the search, a thought which urged her
to remove the leverets at dusk. But where?
The nearest spot that commended itself to her
was at the foot of <a id='bart'></a>Bartinney, about a mile
distant; and the way thither led across the
trails of fox and badger, who might surprise her
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
with her burden, and have her at their mercy.
Her position was a very difficult one; to stay
was perilous, to shift was no less so. Uncertain
what to do for the best, she remained irresolute
till the stars began to peep; then, hoping against
hope that the fox might not come after all, she
decided to remain. In any case she must go
and feed, yet setting-out time came and went
whilst the hare kept to the form. She could
not tear herself away from her young with
this danger hanging over them. A sickle moon
lit hill and plain and threw into relief the coping-stone
of the wall on which the eyes of the
anxious mother were fixed. Against the granite
she could not fail to see the dark form of
her enemy. The better to observe, the hare
raised herself on her hind legs; and the leverets,
thinking she was going to play with them, stood
up too, resting their forefeet against her sides;
but at a whisper from their mother they sank
down again into a sitting posture. The night
wore on, however, without sign of the fox, and
at length the hare, feeling somewhat reassured,
set out for the nearest feeding-ground. There
she browsed until midnight, when apprehension
for her young drove her back to the hill.
Although she found all well, she stayed close by
and fed on the rough herbage near the summit.
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
When she returned to the form her fears had
nearly subsided; by dusk they no longer haunted
her, and in a day or two she dismissed the fox
from her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought that her enemy, satisfied that the
hill was bare of prey, would not trouble her again,
so that it came as a surprise when, a few mornings
later, she espied a vixen at the foot of the
slope, endeavouring to solve the puzzle of the
scent the hare had left on her way to the form
less than an hour before. It was strange how
little the sight perturbed her, but when unaffected
by her extreme anxiety for the leverets she knew
from experience there was no real need for fear.
Never once had she known a fox to succeed in
tracing her from foiled ground, though in the
past she had known many who had tried as the
vixen was now trying. There near the wall
the creature persisted in the almost hopeless
task, following now this way, now that along the
many lines of scent to discover the final course
taken by the hare after her last leap. Over and
over again she seemed on the point of giving
it up: the network of trails maddened and bewildered
her; and her irritation made her snap
viciously at the long bramble spray in which
her brush got entangled. Presently, in her
despair, she made a cast at random; as luck
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
would have it, she hit the true line. At once
she was all alive; her brush, which had hung
lifeless, now wagged furiously, and at the sight
of her enemy’s success the hare grew uneasy.
Slowly, very slowly, the vixen advanced along
the trail as if fearful of losing what had cost
her so much trouble to find. Anon she came
to the place above the clump of blossoming furze
where since the midday visit the hare had
woven another maze of tracks before coming
to the leaping-place by the form. On reaching
it the vixen tried to follow the trail as it had
been laid, but the criss-crossing it had received
so confused her that presently she lost patience
and made a short cast beyond. Here she
happened on a part of the trail where the hare
had returned on her foil, and on coming to the
spot near the ruin where it ended she actually
raised her mask as if she believed the hare had
taken wing and might be seen in mid-air. For
a moment she seemed to despair again; but the
hunger caused by the night’s bad hunting and
the thought of her five ravenous cubs goaded her
on; she shook the dew from her coat and made
another cast. This took her within a dozen
yards of the spot where mother and young
squatted flat on the ground. It seemed that the
vixen must scent them; had there been a breath
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
of wind she could hardly have failed; but the
air was still; not a spray or blade moved save
those disturbed by the vixen as she moved
hither and thither with ears widespread to catch
the slightest sound. A stifled cry, the faintest
rustle in that silence must have betrayed them;
through the trying, critical seconds, however,
they never moved, they scarcely breathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vixen seemed loath to leave the spot;
but at length she quitted it for the summit,
where she searched the fallen stones and scaled
the crumbled walls, her form clearly outlined
against the sky now tinted with orange by the
coming day. On the stone lintel she presently
came to a stand, arrested by the sight of the
sun which peeped above the eastern hills and
warned her that it was time to be seeking her
earth. Reluctant as she was to obey, she dropped
to the ground and made her way slowly down
the shadowed slope. Half-way in the descent
she suddenly turned her mask and scrutinised
the ground in the hope of catching the hare with
head raised watching her retreat; but bush,
rock, and frond alone met her roving eyes.
Near the Giant’s Bowl she again looked back,
and by the expression on her face, now vindictive
rather than perplexed, <a id='seem'></a>seemed to say: “Wily
one, you’ve beaten me this dawn, but I’ll lick my
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
chops over you yet, both you and your tender
young ones.” Then, the rumble of wheels
urging her, she hurried away, her beautiful coat
all aripple with the play of her lissom limbs. As
soon as she had crossed the wall, the hare,
who had observed her from behind the blades,
resumed the suckling of her frightened young,
fondling them as she had never done before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a narrow escape, and the hare
was now all impatience to forsake the hill.
But that could not be before nightfall, so she
and the leverets spent the long day unnerved
by the rank scent left by the fox on the herbage.
The slow sun at last sank beneath the sea.
At once the hare took the doe leveret in her
mouth and carried it along the southern flank
of the chain for more than a mile to the foot
of Bartinney, where she laid it in a patch of
bracken bordering a little green. The next
moment she was on her way back at her best
pace, as though she dreaded that the vixen might
forestall her. But no enemy was to be seen:
the jack was as she had left him. Seizing him
by the skin of the neck she bore him rapidly
along despite his kicking, crouching whilst two
stoats passed, dropping him thrice to rest herself,
and finally depositing him in a clump of rushes
by a rill some score yards from his sister. It
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
was not without a reason that she laid them on
opposite sides of the green, for by thus separating
them she hoped that at least one might
escape detection in the event of a visit from an
enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On collecting himself after his strange experience,
the jack sat and listened to the music
of the water, whilst through an opening in the
rushes his eyes scanned the green, whose close
velvety sward seemed to cry aloud to be gambolled
on. There, so the country people aver,
the <a id='green'></a>fairies forgather to hold high revel on the
inviting turf, tripping to the tinkling of the falls,
in the dark-green ring lighted by innumerable
glow-worms. No little folk appeared that night,
however; nothing in fact came near until the
hare returned to attend to her young, before
vanishing like the wraith she seemed and
ensconcing herself in some brambles on the
lip of the green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not been there long when a <a id='mag'></a>magpie
left his resting-place in the hawthorn overhanging
the turf and stood preening his feathers on the
topmost spray. Presently, his quick eyes noted
the marks left by the hare’s pads on the dewy
surface, and examined them searchingly as if to
learn the identity of the trespasser. He imagined
that a badger or a fox had made them; the
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
thought that a hare—he had only seen one—had
crossed the green never entered his head,
much less that a family of hares was at that
moment lying hidden around it. The inquisitive
bird was soon joined by his mate, and after a
little chatter he flew away with her towards a
homestead from which the smoke was just
beginning to rise. They alighted on the elder-tree
springing from the wall of the rickyard, the
white of their plumage very conspicuous in the
bright level rays which lit them up and fired the
dormer-window of the thatched roof beyond.
By and by they dropped into the yard, where
amongst the straw they found an egg. They
broke and ate it. Then the hen-bird came flying
back in great haste to the nest, as if she feared
her precious clutch might be chilled and become
addled. Later the cock-bird returned to tell
her what was happening in the farmyard, and
at once flew back to the elder. He was back
again in half an hour: indeed he kept flying to
and fro until sundown. The hare rejoiced in
the restlessness of this arch-mobber of vermin:
it gave her a sense of security such as she had
not felt since the birth of her young. For her
the magpie was an untiring patrol, and further,
one gifted with a tongue that would make the
boldest fox shrink from the insults it was capable
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
of raining on him. Her fears fled in the presence
of this sentinel of the wild, so that for a few
minutes during the afternoon she actually fell
asleep. “If only there were some night-bird to
watch over us,” she thought while she sat awaiting
dusk. And as soon as darkness fell an owl
began hooting. At once, as if she took it for
a signal, she stole from the form to attend to
her young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her visit was most welcome to the jack, who
was very sorry when she withdrew. He listened
to her retreating steps, and as they died away
tried to combat the feeling of loneliness that
beset him. In the weary watch that followed he
sorely missed the companion of his waking
hours. He felt forlorn without her soft, warm
side to nestle against; but in a night or two he
found something to occupy him. He took to
grooming himself, and off and on spent hours
brushing his ears and licking his coat, especially
the snow-white fur on his belly, which had looked
so ghostly as his mother bore him through the
dusk. He made himself as clean as a pink,
and when the feeling of isolation wore off, as it
soon did, he felt as happy as a strong, healthy
leveret could feel. Soon, however, his muscles
began to ache for want of exercise: they kept
urging him to throw aside his fears and break
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
his narrow bounds; but night after night he
resisted the impulse. At last inaction became
unendurable. Regardless of his mother’s
monitions and the whispers of instinct, he leapt
the rill and raced about the moonlit green
like a thing possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly he was joined by his sister, and
never perhaps did two leverets enjoy their stolen
freedom more. They bounded over each other’s
back; they leapt the rock by the thorn, clearing
it by a good foot; they galloped round and
round like performers in a circus. Tiring of
this, they rose on their hind legs and sparred
with their pads, moving about the fairy ring and
patting each other’s face like boxers. But whilst
they were thus engaged the snapping of a brier
disturbed the night and sent them to their seats.
With wildly beating hearts they sat till the
clumsy <a id='badger'></a>badger who had trodden on the spray
passed out of hearing; then out they came again
and renewed their frolics, which lasted without
further interruption till the moon began to
pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their mother found them in their seats looking
as innocent as could be; but she knew of their
escapade from the scent on the green and,
recognising in this bid for liberty a token that
the time was come for leading them out, she
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
resolved to devote herself to this duty without
further delay. So the following night, instead of
returning at early dawn, she hurried back in the
small hours and surprised the culprits, not, as
she expected, in the midst of their games, but
nibbling the grass of the green. At the sight
of their mother the guilty creatures scurried to
their forms, only to bound out at her summons
and follow frisking at her heels as she led past
the spring to the hill. She breasted the slope at
a slow canter, but soon quickened her steps.
Half-way up she began doubling, the leverets
imitating her twists and turns in a surprising
way and with astonishing exactness. Towards
daybreak, however, they flagged, and by the
time they got back to the green they were
so tired that they were content to remain in
the form till the hour for exercise came round
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare returned nightly at almost the same
moment, and went farther and farther afield as
their strength grew, without encountering even
in these extended excursions any enemy more
formidable than an old badger, who never dreamt
of pursuit. It is true that he looked hard at
them, but only because of his surprise at seeing
survivors of a race which he thought extinct.
The instant he satisfied himself they really were
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
hares, he resumed his grunting and crossed the
ridge on the way to his earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first faint blush in the east the hares
sped towards the pool that fills the hollow
between Bartinney and Chapel Carn Brea.
There near the edge of the water the leverets
confused their trails and chose their seats. This
they did under the eyes of their mother, who
watched interestedly from the slope where she
lay amongst the heather. As it proved, no
precautions were necessary, for no creature
came near; indeed, nothing disturbed the drowsy
stillness till late in the day, when a breeze
sprang up that sent the water in tiny wavelets
against the rushy shore. This immunity from
molestation was the result of the hare’s knowledge
of the ways of her enemies, of their retreats, and
especially of the times of their coming and going.
At every outing they crossed the foul line left by
some marauder on its way to the lowland, but—those
of the badger excepted—never a homing
trail; for the hares were settled in their forms
before fox, polecat, and stoat came slinking back
to their lairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not even the hare, with cunning quickened
by the dependence of her young, could
provide against every contingency. On the
fourth day of their stay by the pool, when they
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
were back in their seats around the green, they
were discovered and attacked by a bloodthirsty
little creature that was abroad foraging in the
very middle of the morning. The hare’s
suspicions were first aroused by the angry cries
of some small birds in the corner of the nearest
field. Soon the demonstration grew more and
more distinct, showing that the birds were
pursuing the object of their displeasure in the
direction of the green. From the first the
noise attracted the attention of the magpie.
Immediately he saw the birds he cocked his
head, now this way now that, as if beholding
the most interesting sight of his life. And a
strange sight it certainly was; for, accompanied
by linnets and finches that fluttered over it,
there came with the quick movement of its kind,
a weasel, seemingly quite indifferent to the
mobbing it received. As soon as it appeared
the hare quivered in every limb; but there
was no shiver of fear, for when presently the
little miscreant scented the jack and stood on
its hind legs screaming, to paralyse him with
terror, she bounded across the green, and with
a stroke of a forepad sent the animal flying
into the water. Undaunted, and enraged at
this treatment, the weasel now confronted the
hare herself, only to be knocked over, trampled
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
on, and spurned to the middle of the green,
where it lay on its back kicking as though its
last hour was come. Whereupon the magpie,
who, considering the <a id='wease'></a>weasel too insignificant for
his intervention, had hitherto held its tongue,
chattered loudly as if to applaud the deed;
whilst the hare, whose blood was up, remained
within a yard of the weasel, ready to renew
the battle should it again show fight. Braver
still, the <a id='linnet'></a>linnet whose eggs the weasel had
been sucking, as was evident from the stain
on its muzzle, stood within a few inches and
upbraided it for the wrong done her, and, frail
thing though she was, scarcely deigned to move
when shortly it regained its feet and made for
the hill. It was not allowed to sneak away
unattended; birds and hare—strange allies—accompanied
the discomfited little wretch past
the spring to the heather, where it wormed its
way amongst the stems and hid itself from view.
Then the linnets and finches, having avenged
their friend, flew back to their thickets; and
the hare, crouching low as if frightened now
by her own shadow, stole to her form. The
magpie still perched on the spray from which
he had witnessed the scene. The arch-rogue
had thoroughly enjoyed every phase of it, and
now that it was over he was all alive, quizzing
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
the spots where the hare and the leverets lay,
as if trying to get a view of them amidst the
cover. At last he too flew away; then no
trace remained of the participators in the drama
but a tiny feather that lay where the linnet
had stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visit of the weasel had its consequences,
for the hare, fearing that the creature would
return when she was away foraging, resolved to
take the leverets with her at setting-out time,
and after she had regained her composure she
sat planning the round she would lead them.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>EDUCATION</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low summons of the hare drew the
leverets to her side, and when she set out they
followed close at her heels. Late as she was
in starting, she picked her way down the rough
foothills very slowly and with extreme caution;
indeed, so halting was her advance, so mistrustful
was she of every rock and bush, that
she might have been Fear herself leading her
offspring past ambuscades. But the moment
she set foot on the reclaimed land—the field
where the linnet was roosting by her empty
nest—she quickened her steps and passed rapidly
from enclosure to enclosure, the novices wondering
at the smoothness of the ground and
shrinking from the shadows cast by the gates
under which they crept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the little band entered the grassy lane
which led past the <a id='mag2'></a>magpie’s elder to the farmhouse,
and there the leverets got a scare from
some fowls packed as close as they could sit
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
on a limb of the solitary sycamore. The birds
mistook the hares for foxes, and in their panic
dislodged the rooster<a id='roost'></a> from his perch. The
extraordinary noise he made, as with a great
flapping of wings he fell to the ground,
frightened the leverets almost out of their lives;
in their terror they pressed so close to their
mother’s side that the three were for a moment
jammed in the gap by which they entered the
neighbouring pasture. But the leverets showed
no fear of the kine that lay there chewing their
cud, or of the ewes and lambs in the next
enclosure but one, passing in and out amongst
them as unconcernedly as if born and reared
in their midst. In the adjoining field the
wanderers remained to feed on the abundant
crop of clover, which furnished so sumptuous
a feast for the leverets after the poor herbage
of the green that they would have eaten to
excess had not their mother called them off.
It was not that, however, which made her lead
them away, but her eagerness to show them
the country and teach them all she knew.
Moreover, she was anxious to acquaint them
with their powers, especially with their ability
to swim, for it would stand them in good
stead when pressed by enemies, as she knew
by experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
So, on leaving the clover, she made in the
direction of the moorland pool to which her
mother had led her when young, where, owing
to the absence of all but the scantiest cover,
no enemy could approach unobserved. Annoyed
at having to leave the clover, the leverets
followed with reluctance, till presently the stillness
was broken by the music of running water.
At the sound the jack pricked his ears as though
he recognised a familiar voice. It was indeed
the rill, but swollen now by tributary runnels
into a little stream three feet wide at the
shallows where the hares crossed. On the bridle-path
leading to the hamlet of <a id='crow'></a>Crowz-an-Wra
the leverets raced up and down, whilst the
hare sat on the turfy border by an old cross
and watched them. In the profound silence
the beating of their pads on the hard surface
was loud enough to mask the approach of a
stealthy enemy; of this the leverets seemed
fully conscious, for they stood motionless at
short intervals and listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time after time the only sound that filled
the pause was the subdued but solemn roar of
the sea about the cliffs of the <a id='end'></a>Land’s End.
Presently, however, there broke upon it an
ominous “patter, patter, patter.” In an instant
the timorous creatures were flying. Near a
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
heap of stones they stopped and listened with
ears a-cock, and there again came that “patter,
patter, patter,” very faint at first but rapidly
growing more and more distinct. Whoever
the pursuer, he was coming along at a rapid
pace. The rhythm of the footfall fascinated
the hares. They stood with eyes fixed on the
track to get a view the moment the creature
showed. But all at once the noise ceased, to
the obvious disquiet of the hare. She snuffled
and snorted as when in the presence of the
weasel, and set off again at a swinging pace
with the leverets, now thoroughly alarmed,
obedient to her every movement. Suddenly
she bounded from the path to the selvedge of
turf. On landing she leapt again and again.
The leverets followed as if tied to her, leaping
nearly as far as she did, for already they could
cover nine feet in a spring. Then they sped
over croft and field till, quite a mile from the
track, they came to a level waste with the
pool in its midst. She was about to lead them
into the water when she noticed the jack on
his hind legs surveying the moor. Stung by
this reminder of her negligence, she leapt to the
bank and looked in the direction of the trail. She
looked long, but saw no sign of the pursuer,
and then, completely satisfied that all was well,
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
rejoined the leverets, who followed her without
shrinking towards the middle of the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as if the long-legged creatures would
never get out of their depth, yet they lost their
foothold at last, fell to swimming, and soon
gained the opposite bank. In their wet coats
they looked more leggy than ever, but regained
their usual appearance after shaking themselves
a time or two. Then the hare again scanned
the almost bare surface and, seeing nothing,
gave up all thought of the enemy and devoted
herself to her young. Her eyes were all for
them: she had not another glance for her back
trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her lack of vigilance was the opportunity
of the dog fox who had struck their line in
the clover-field and followed it to the moor,
which he was now scrutinising from the only
rock that rose above it. He looked everywhere
but at the right spot. In his ignorance
of a hare’s ways he did not examine the pool,
till a slight disturbance of the surface arrested
his wandering gaze: even then he thought
that the ripples were caused by wildfowl; but
the moon emerged from the black cloud that
had obscured it, and revealed the three hares
frisking in the shallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fox licked his chops at the rare sight,
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
and hopeless though he thought the stalk, resolved
to attempt it. Instantly he slipped from
the rock and stole forward, taking advantage of
the meanest tuft to conceal his approach. Yet
for all his cleverness he was a conspicuous object,
and had the hare been alert she could not
have failed to see him. Once, indeed, she did
seem uneasy, as if vaguely conscious of danger;
the <a id='fox'></a>fox, whose eyes never left her, was quick
to see that, and when she looked his way he
was rigid in his stride and escaped observation.
But immediately she turned he resumed
his advance, and soon it seemed he might succeed
in his murderous design. Noiseless as a
phantom, he drew nearer and nearer till, with
ears flat and body crouching to the ground, he
reached the stunted rushes on the margin of
the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he was so near the hares that when they
shook themselves the spray all but reached him.
Again and again with his cruel eyes he measured
the distance, and as often refrained from launching
himself: he would not spoil the stalk by a
rash step, for at any moment the hares might
approach within reach of his spring, or they
might re-enter the pool and be at his mercy.
And it looked as if his patience would be rewarded,
for in a second or two, seconds which
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
seemed hours, the jack moved towards him.
Another yard and his fate would be sealed. But
he stopped to scratch one of his ears; and when
he was about to advance again there came from
out the stillness a breath of wind laden with
the foul scent of the marauder. Quicker than
thought the affrighted creature whipped round
and followed his mother and sister, who were
already in full retreat. As the leveret turned,
the fox made a tremendous spring, but he landed
four feet short and could only make a frantic
effort to overtake it. For a score yards or so
the chase was most exciting, neither gained nor
lost; but the terrific pace was beyond the power
of the fox to maintain, and as he fell behind the
jack drew farther and farther away, increasing
his lead so much that presently reynard desisted
from pursuit. Panting he stood and watched,
craning his neck to get a last view as the conspicuous
scuts disappeared from sight. Then,
after a glance at the sky, the disappointed hunter
made back over the moor, slowly at first but
quickening his pace as he went, his neat footprints
commingling here and there in the soft
ground with the nail-pricks of the hares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hares, on discovering that the fox had
given up pursuit, slackened speed, and when
they reached Brea Farm lingered awhile to
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
feed before withdrawing for the day. In the
grey dawn they crossed the wall and made
their way towards the old chantry. Half-way
to the summit the leverets, apparently without
a hint, separated first from the hare and then
from each other, and secreted themselves in
seats where the sun would find them early and
where, weary after their long round, they soon
passed from drowsiness into a sound sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week that followed was singularly void
of disquieting incidents; nevertheless it was a
period of great importance in the life of the
jack, because of the signs of independence that
manifested themselves in his conduct. Hitherto
he had been tractable enough considering his
sex; under the influence of fear he had been a
model of good behaviour; now all was changed,
suddenly changed. The night following his
escape from the fox, he stayed behind in the
clover-field long after his mother had gone on,
and—a thing he had never done before—took no
notice of her repeated calls except to twitch his
ears as if annoyed at her persistency. Then the
very next night he obstinately refused to leave
the wheatfield, though his mother shook with
fright as she told him that she had just seen a
polecat looking out of a rabbit-hole in the hedge,
and that to stay might cost him his life. But she
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
might as well have besought the granite rubbing-post
near them for all the heed the self-willed
creature gave; he simply went on nibbling. On
both occasions she had to come back and fetch
him, and thoroughly did he deserve the drumming
he got.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disliked being punished, but did not
mend his ways. Indeed he grew worse. A
few nights later—it was Tuesday, because the
Sennen men were at bell-practice—his mother
all at once missed him and, going back,
found him standing on his hind legs gazing
at a scarecrow. The beaver-hatted object had
excited his curiosity, and he was waiting to
see it move. That was no great offence:
before two hours had passed, however, the
incorrigible fellow gave her the slip, and by
making use of the “leaping” ruse she had
taught him, prevented her from tracing him.
She gave him up for lost; but the truant was
happy enough, roaming amidst the barley or
playing among the shadows cast by a stone-circle,
confident in his knowledge of the country
and his ability to find his way back to the hill.
Yet he must have had misgivings or got scared,
for he returned to the Carn at a very early
hour; and there his mother found him looking
sheepish enough after his spell of freedom. She
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
had not sought him in order to rebuke him,
for she had given up both complaining and
correction; she had come solely to satisfy herself
that he was safe. In a way she rejoiced in
his independence, knowing that the time was
fast approaching when he would have to fend
for himself.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And because the moment of separation
was imminent, she led him and his sister that
very night to the spot beloved above all others
by the hares of the Land’s End, the dunes of
<a id='senn'></a>Sennen and the long strand of <a id='wbay'></a>Whitesand
Bay. She took a bee-line from the Carn
and, leading at a good pace, soon reached her
destination, where the leverets, pleased by the
feel of the sand under their pads, hopped and
skipped like lambs, or like runners in an arena
with dunes for spectators and waves to applaud,
galloped after their fleet-footed mother with the
speed of the wind. Their disappearance into the
gloom and sudden reappearance made them seem
quite uncanny on that uncanny foreshore,
haunted, if tradition be true, by drowned sailors
who hail one another across the beach. The
surge beat on the shore, the swell boomed in
the near caves, the breeze stirred the rushes
tufting the dunes: except for these the hares
were alone; but the light gleamed across the
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
waters from the <a id='long'></a>Longships, and near midnight
the faint sweep of muffled oars told where the
Preventive Patrol crossed the bay. The unusual
noise caused the hares to cease their scamperings
and look seaward. Yet danger was not there
but at the foot of the dunes, where a half-wild
cat crouched near the path by which they came
and eagerly awaited their return. All unconscious
of her presence the hares left the beach to play
on the rocks at <a id='genv'></a>Genvor Head, now uncovered
by the tide; there the jack, prompted by the
adventurous spirit that was ever urging him to
do “something grand,” made along the ledge
towards the point over which the sea was dashing
dangerously. Luckily his mother observed him
and drove him back, despite the efforts he made
to get past her. So he turned sulky and
lagged behind her and his sister when presently
they crossed the dunes for the feeding-ground.
The cat, who had been a close observer of
the scene on the rocks, and was not a little
chagrined when two of the hares passed wide
of her station, now fixed her attention on the
jack, as his slow movements made her think
he was wounded and might fall an easy prey.
But again she was doomed to disappointment;
for while she debated whether to rush at
the leveret or stay where she was, the jack
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
recovered his temper and went off at full speed
over the dunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='graym'></a>Graymalkin naturally thought she had seen
the last of him. Leaving her hiding-place, she
went and sat by the mouth of a rabbit-hole,
to try to secure one of the occupants when
it came out. She might have been there a
quarter of an hour when to her surprise she
saw the jack pass on his way to the beach. He
was making straight for the rocks. Without
a moment’s hesitation she followed, so quickly
that when he reached the point of the rocks,
she had gained the shore end and cut off his
retreat. Yellow though she was, it is a wonder
that he did not see her as she crossed the
sand, but he did not; what first drew his
attention was the mewing noise she made
whilst creeping panther-like to the spot where
the rocks contract to a narrow waist which the
hare must pass. There she stopped. At sight
of the hideous creature he realised the straits
he was in, and in his terror backed involuntarily
nearer and nearer to the edge; the sea as it
surged over the rock reached half-way up his
legs, the spray drenched him, but he seemed
indifferent to it all. He looked thoroughly woebegone;
he was surely doomed; if the sea did
not get him, the cat would. Presently he stopped
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
backing when only six inches from the edge and,
pulling himself together, tried to think of a way
of escape. But he found it difficult to think
under the eyes of the brute crouching there.
His best chance was to swim to Genvor Beach,
but this never entered his head; the bewildered
fellow was debating as best he could whether
it was better to spring over the cat or dodge
her. Had it not been for the bunch of seaweed
at the very spot on which he would alight he
would have tried the spring; but in the circumstances
he decided to risk all on the zigzag
ruse, at which he was an adept, having played
it with his sister on the green. Like an arrow
from a bow he shot forward as if he meant to
pass to the right of the cat; as soon as his pads
touched the rock, like lightning he swerved to
the left; then he shot ahead again and so got
away without a scratch. The cat, thoroughly
outwitted, had sprung for the place where she
had supposed the hare would be; but she
sprang at the air and fell into the sea. Almost
immediately a wave washed her on the rocks,
and there she stood silent while, with eyes like
living coals, she watched the jack disappear over
the dunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terrified fellow ran for two miles along his
mother’s trail without halting; then coming to
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
some briers he stopped to nibble the shoots, for
he was very hungry. He would have stayed
longer than he did had not the rosy foreglow in
the sky warned him to be off. So again he
took to the trail and hurried along at his best
pace, scaring the boy at Brea Farm, who took
him for a <a id='pix'></a>pixie, as he whisked past the gap on
his way to the <a id='green2'></a>Fairies’ Green, where for an hour
or more his mother and sister had been sitting in
their forms. The magpies saw him coming, but
chattered no reproach to the belated creature;
though to a fox cub they would have shown no
mercy. After he had made his toilet, enjoying
the taste of the salt water, he sat moving his
jaws as if he were chewing the cud. He
was really crushing some grains of sand, of
which he had picked up a mouthful on the beach,
and the curious noise completely puzzled the
magpies, who tried in vain to locate it. The
dew was being fast dried up by the sun before
it ceased: then the slow regular rise and fall
of his flank told he was asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the hare took the jack and his
sister a way they had not been before. It led
over Caer Bran to Boswarthen, where all three
gambolled like mad things in the corn before
going down the hill to <a id='tregon'></a>Tregonebris. There,
after feasting on the pinks in which the farmer’s
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
wife took special pride, they passed to the field of
mowing-grass before the house and played on
the heap of earth in the far corner, the hare
joining in the frolics with a zest she had not shown
since she led them up Bartinney. By this time
the air, which had been oppressively close, had
become more sultry than ever, till towards
midnight the impending storm broke, zigzagging
the inky sky with fierce lightning. Immediately
the silence was rent by claps of thunder, and a
torrent of rain followed which drenched the hares
before they could gain the shelter of the hedge.
When at length it ceased they galloped up and
down the path leading to the house and dried
themselves; but they were drenched again before
dawn. They looked a forlorn little band as they
ambled over the fields in a downpour. Yet,
miserable though their plight seemed, they passed
a clump of brambles which at least offered a
partial refuge; farther up the hill they passed
another, more inviting still; indeed they kept on
as if regardless of all cover till they reached the
summit of Caer Bran, where they sought seats
under the furze mantling the slope of the outer
of the earthworks that crown it. The wind
blew, the rain pelted, but the high bank and
domed roof protected them from all discomfort
save that caused by the drippings of the sodden
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
bushes. This the creatures endured through the
long day without once stirring in their forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare rose at her usual time, but instead
of setting out forthwith as was her custom she
went to where the jack lay and licked his face
again and again, which she had not done since
he was weaned. What was the meaning of this
extraordinary display of affection? Was it to
solace him for the severity of her schooling and
growing coldness? Not at all. It was to mark
the moment of separation; it was her last office
to him; it was her farewell greeting. The jack
understood; his behaviour showed it. For
when presently his mother and sister set out, he,
hitherto always the second afoot, remained in the
form and watched them pass from sight. As the
bushes hid them, he was on the point of rising to
follow, but restrained himself and sat listening as
if in expectation of the call. The low bleat for
which he hearkened did not come; there was no
sound but the moan of the wind about the old
earthworks. Then the seriousness of the position
came home to him: his mother and sister had
gone out of his life; the freedom for which he had
been yearning was at last his. Was he elated?
Far from it. A sense of forlornness possessed
him, but this was soon to be banished by the
high spirits that surged through him and thrilled
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
his whole being. Whilst he sat addressing
himself to the struggle before him the sky
suddenly cleared, and where all had been black,
stars shone in the steadfast blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he arose, stretched his perfect limbs,
and, after a glance along the trail, set his face
for the farm-lands to which his mother had the
previous night introduced him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span><h1><a id='c03'></a>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>INDEPENDENCE</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leveret’s wonderful memory for country he
had once been over enabled him to find his way
straight back to the farm, where with timid
steps he passed from enclosure to enclosure,
exploring his domain. In his round he came
on a field of clover, another of turnips, two of
corn, pastures with sheep and cattle, and a
pound with a donkey in it, familiar objects
which served to make him forget his solitary
condition till he came to the scene of the
previous night’s frolics; then the thought of his
mother and sister flashed across his mind: he
became alive to his loneliness. But a voice
within whispered, “Courage, courage, all will
soon be well”; at this he took heart and
strove to forget the past as he resumed his
way, observant of everything and alert to the
many dangers of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a field of mowing-grass and again in the
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
oats he caught the rank scent of an enemy—luckily
in time to avoid it and withdraw without
being discovered. Now and again he stopped to
nibble a bit of tempting herbage; but he did
not settle down to feed until the small hours,
when he returned to the clover. Here he
remained till the first flush in the sky warned
him he must seek a retreat in which to pass
the day. Twice he made towards the gate as
if he were leaving the field, as often retraced
his steps, presently repaired to the spot where
the clover was most luxuriant, and lay there.
No sooner, however, had he sat down than he
realised that the stems which shut out the sight
of everything prevented him from seeing an
enemy, should one approach. The lack of outlook
troubled him: soon he imagined that he
could hear the faint sound of a stealthy footfall.
To satisfy himself that he was mistaken he
kept raising his head and looking round until,
unable to endure the misery any longer, he
stole from the seat and hurried back to the
highest part of the farm, where a hedge had
taken his fancy as he had crossed from the
barley to the oats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, amongst the coarse grasses, beneath
the fronds of a solitary brake-fern, he sat with
his face to the dawn-wind, which played with his
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
whiskers, swayed the ears of the barley, and
buffeted the smoke rising from the chimney of
the homestead. The light was still grey, but
beyond the low roof of the byre the hills stood
expectant of the sun, whose fiery disc soon
bathed summit and slope with its richest rays.
The conspicuous heights attracted the eyes of
the leveret till the orb rose higher and made a
glory of the dew on the leaves of the tree
amidst the barley; then the sparkling beads won
and held his gaze; later the tree itself so
absorbed his attention that he seemed to be
wondering what it did there. It certainly was
a strange place for a tree, especially for a fruit-tree,
though it was not strange to the people
familiar with its story. The field, or rather a
part of it, had formerly been a garden—it is
still called <a id='gard'></a>Johanna’s Garden; and sentiment had
caused the tree to be spared, though it interfered
with the plough and attracted badgers who trod
down the crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leveret had not been long in his form
before one of these animals crossed the opposite
bank, shaking the dew from the wild roses that
festooned the creep, and made its way through
the barley and the oats to the sett at the
foot of the steep slope. Here a colony of
<a id='badger2'></a>badgers lived. The lane in the corn was their
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
highway, and the tree a convenient stretching-post,
so that next to the crowing of the cocks,
the scratching noise made by powerful claws
was the most familiar noise of the grey dawn.
Luckily the leveret had no fear of the badgers,
no more fear of them indeed than of the long-tailed
tit whom he watched coming and going
with food for a brood of insatiable nestlings in
the near furze-bush. The cries of the young tits,
all eager for the food she brought, were at times
the only sound that broke the silence of the
sequestered spot; there were days when scarcely
a breath stirred, when the stalks of the barley
were as motionless as the stem of the tree, and
the shadow of the frond looked like a stain on
the leveret’s coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He enjoyed the slumbrous peace, and revelled
in the noonday heat that shimmered above the
array of barley ears and veiled with a pearly haze
valley and hills and all the land between. It was
a delightful time, which in his innocence he thought
would last for ever. He knew nothing of the
ways of husbandry, of the harvesting of crops by
the dwellers of the homestead, whence by day
came shout and song, and where the strange light
glowed in the early hours of foraging time. He
did not know that man was lord of the earth; as
little did he realise that he himself was man’s
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
guest. His own view was quite different. He
thought that the clover, the corn, and the pinks
grew for him, that fern and heather flourished to
afford him cover, that hedge and hill rose above
the level merely to furnish him with outlook. He
even thought that the sun rose to warm him, that
moon and stars shone to light his steps; and he
found the world a most delectable place, despite
the number of his enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A somewhat rude awakening befell him on the
thirteenth day of his independence, when the field
was invaded by the farm folk. Their coming, or
rather their inrush, had nothing to do with the
harvesting of the barley, which was yet green;
they were drawn thither by an incident of farm
life that is attended with as much noise as human
beings are capable of making. The hubbub
broke out near the house some two furlongs
away. Even at that distance the din was disquieting,
but it grew louder and louder and
caused the leveret more and more perturbation.
Whilst he wondered what it all meant,
a swarm of <a id='bees'></a>bees came flying over the hedge
and settled on the tree. In less than a
minute three boys, two men, and a woman
came tumbling pell-mell over the hedge, shouting
“Brownie, Brownie,” and beating frying-pans
and milk-pails. The boy who led soon espied
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
the cluster of bees hanging to the branch, and
cried, “Here they are, faither, fastened on the
old medlar-tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Th—that’s lucky, lad,” replied the father
breathlessly as his face showed above the hedge,
“I feared we’d seed the laist of ’em. Go and
fetch a skep and my hat, and don’t forget the
bellows, for I’ve hardly a brith left in me. But,
dang me,” he added angrily, on sighting the lane
in the barley, “what a mess they badgers have
made of the corn. It’s all through that theer
tree, and down it shall come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Johanna’s tree? Cut down Johanna’s
tree? You’ll do nawthin’ of the kind, maister.
’Twas her pride, good soul, so I’ve heered granny
say. Cut it down? Why, ’twould be enough to
make her turn in her grave, and perhaps visit
’ee, who do knaw? And only think a minit,
you’d have lost that swarm of bees, and a
handsome swarm it is. Iss fay, and worth a bra
bit; ‘a swarm of bees in June is worth a silver
spoon,’ and you’d have lost it if the tree hadn’t
been theere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, Betty, most likely you’re right. I
never looked at it that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, maister, it don’t take much to make
people forget their obligations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, Betty, have done, theere’s a good
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
woman; I spoke in haste. I’ll never lay hands
on Johanna’s tree. And here comes our Jesse
already. The lad’s as fast as a hare, and if he’s
forgotten the bellows he’s remembered the cloth
to ground the hive on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the skep, the farmer shook the bees
into it and laid it on the cloth which Jesse had
spread at the foot of the tree. “They’ll do all
right theere till the sun is gone, when I’ll come
myself and fetch ’em. Now let’s make haste back
and finish our fish and taties, or they’ll be too
cold to be worth eating. What do you say,
Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, maister, a cold pilcher ed’n
much account, nor a cold tatie nother. I’d
as soon sit down to a basin of sky blue and
sinker,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> and that ed’n sayin’ much.” With that,
man and master, Betty and the boys quitted the
field, leaving the hare to his reflections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole proceeding was a mystery to the
timid wildling, who had kept to his seat notwithstanding
Betty’s shrill voice and gesticulations.
Some hares would have slipped away, but it was
instinctive in him to lie close until found; a trait
of his strain which went far to explain the survival
of his forbears amidst the gradual disappearance
of their kind. But though satisfied that he was
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
not the object of the visit as he had at first
feared, he was glad when the party went away
and left him to solitude. The rest of the day
was without incident, save that the farmer, true
to his word, came and fetched the bees at
sundown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swarming of the bees and their capture
was followed a week later by a further disquieting
incident, the cutting of the clover. It quite took
his breath away one morning when he reached
the gate, to find the crop levelled and the look
of the enclosure changed almost beyond recognition:
the hedges too had grown so much taller.
The timid fellow shrank from entering the field;
indeed the presence of three <a id='rabb'></a>rabbits feeding there
would alone have sufficed to prevent it. On
several occasions these very rabbits had shown
themselves hostile and driven him off. Rabbits
were by no means plentiful on his beats; he had
not seen more than a score; and as for hares, he
had not only not met with one, he had not crossed
a single trail. He was the solitary survivor of
his kind, with enemies on every hand. Nevertheless,
confident in the protection which his wiles
and speed afforded him, he enjoyed life to the
full, roaming over the farms in the highest of
spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he exulted in his powers he ran no
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
risks; even the buck his father had not been so
wary as he. Whilst feeding he kept to the
middle of the field, where at frequent intervals
he sat up and looked about him, first to leeward,
then to windward, his nostrils working all the
time, to assure himself that no enemy was near.
Then he always slowed down when approaching
a gate or creep, in order to learn by sight or
smell whether a fox or one of the farm cats was
lying in wait for him; once he winded a fox
and withdrew noiselessly as a shadow, leaving
the fox none the wiser. He was quick in
distinguishing marauders by their footfall and
by the rustling they made in threading the
ripe corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the arrival of harvest, however, he was
completely puzzled by the loud outcry that
arose on the farm-lands. It was always the
same, and caused by the reapers hailing the
cutting of the last sheaf.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> Sometimes while he
was in the form, sometimes when he was afoot,
the silence would be broken by a voice proclaiming
aloud, “I haben, I haben,” followed
by many voices asking, “What have ’ee?
What have ’ee?” and the instant response, “A
neck, a neck,” welcomed by loud hurrahs.
Save for these acclamations of farmer and
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
farm-hands, he was wise in the lore of the
countryside; and with knowledge came confidence,
which led to his wandering farther and
farther afield. He roamed as far as three miles
from the seat, to which he nevertheless continued
to return, until he happened on a wild bottom
which the country folk have named <a id='gold'></a>Golden
Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful starlight night when he
came to the brow overlooking it, and sat down
to gaze at the mill, the pool above it, and the
glimpses of stream showing in the gorse like
silver stitched on black velvet. A <a id='wisp'></a>will o’ the
wisp was flitting to and fro near the bend
of the valley, and a white owl was searching
the stubble before the miller’s cottage; otherwise
nothing stirred; so presently the leveret made
his way down and down the rugged hillside to
the stream. This he followed as far as the
mill-pool; then, after glancing round the rushy
margin, he retraced his steps and crossed the
stream below the mill. Sometimes along the
bank, sometimes within a stone’s throw as the
bushes allowed, he held on to the swampy ground
where the weird light still floated hither and
thither and, passing between patches of iris and
watermint, came to some mounds carpeted with
thyme, on which he remained to feed. From
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
there he overlooked a sheet of water, half-circled
with alders, a fowler’s hut peeping from beneath
a cluster of them. No bird rested on the water,
which was marked only by the rings made by
trout rising at the white moths that came within
their reach. It was a very peaceful scene, with
no breath of wind to diffuse the scent given out
by meadow-sweet and camomile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hungry fellow nibbled unceasingly at
the aromatic herb, avoiding the <a id='worm'></a>glow-worms
which dotted the mounds. On the furze they
were even more numerous, so that their golden-green
lamps lit up the beads of dew on the
spiders’ webs. But the leveret rarely interrupted
his feast to look about him; only once did he
scratch his ears, and whilst so engaged had his
attention attracted by a shrill whistle from the
stream below the pool. Turning his head, he
saw an <a id='otter'></a>otter and two cubs come over the bank
which dammed the pool, and enter the water
with so little disturbance as to make them seem
uncanny. When they dived, their progress
would have been most difficult to follow had
it not been for the leaping of the trout, for the
waves they raised were hardly noticeable even
where the water was shallowest. The otters
rose at different parts of the pool, each with a
trout in its mouth, swam to the bank, and there
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
lay at full length to devour their take. After
fishing for nearly half an hour the animals fell
to playing, now in the water, now on the bank,
at times even in the open spaces among the
bushes. From one of these the cubs espied the
leveret. At once ceasing their gambols, they
watched him nibble the herbage, their nostrils
working all the time. The leveret, who showed
no fear of the strange, short-legged creatures,
was still feeding when the otter recalled her
cubs and led them up the stream, but he was
nearly satisfied, and shortly made his way along
the dam and up the opposite hill to the downs,
over which he kept wandering and wandering
as if in search of a seat. Yet this was not his
object. He had already made up his mind
where he would pass the coming day, took the
hint from a homing badger that it was time to
be ensconced, returned to the valley, and hid
amongst the rushes bordering the <a id='pool'></a>mill-pool, at a
spot almost midway between the inflow and the
hatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had hardly settled down when the otter
and her cubs hurried by along the opposite
bank, on their way to a reedy marsh a mile
above. Then all was quiet till, at peep of day,
a kingfisher came and fished from a branch
of the alder overhanging the inflow; the tinkle
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
of the water as she struck it made a pretty
sound in the silent dawn. Later, just as the
smoke rose from the <a id='mill'></a>miller’s chimney, a moorhen
led out her brood as if to teach them
the geography of the pool, for she kept taking
them from creeklet to creeklet till the miller
came to raise the hatch and drove them all
away. The hum of the water-wheel brought
back to the leveret’s memory the swarm of
bees and the unforgettable din of the reapers;
but if he looked for the invasion of his
new quarters by a posse of men and boys
he must have been agreeably disappointed
when, early in the forenoon, there came only a
solitary <a id='angler'></a>angler, whose entry was so noiseless
as scarcely to disturb the peace of the quiet
spot. Indeed the newcomer stood for a second
or two surveying the pool from the opening
between the withies before the leveret was
aware of his presence. On the discovery the
timid creature thought, naturally enough, that
the pair of restless black eyes were scanning
the bank in search of him; he did not know
they were drawn now here, now there, by the
rising trout. The angler was a tall, spare
man of aquiline features, attired in grey tweed
suit and wearing a dove-coloured top-hat,
about which some fly-casts were neatly wound.
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
His upright figure, thick black curly hair, in
which the few grey hairs seemed out of place,
above all the comeliness of face, marked him
as a man between thirty and forty years of age.
So one would have judged as he stood, though
the ease with which he leapt the ditch to the
sedges spoke rather of twenty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took his position on the turfy bank over
against the leveret, and at once began whipping
together the three pieces of the rod he had
removed from the cloth case, working with
extreme haste as if he feared that the fish would
cease to rise before he was ready. When the
joints were securely tied, he fixed the reel, ran
the line through the rings, and attached the
cast with coch-y-bondhu for end fly, and red
palmer for dropper. Surely he is too impatient
to soak the gut before casting; no, he flings it
into the little creek at his side and, to kill the
time of waiting, paces nervously up and down
the bank. After four turns he took up the rod
and began casting, the flies falling lightly on
the rippled surface. At the third throw he was
fast in a fish, but just failed to steer it clear of
a bed of weeds for which it made, and consequently
lost it. At the very next cast, when the
flies fell close to the hatch, he rose and hooked
a bigger fish. This leapt out of the water and
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
broke its hold. He was much vexed, as the
suddenly compressed lips showed, but as he was
about to give vent to his feelings a still larger
fish rose under the bank, close to the leveret.
This sight checked the word on the very tip
of his tongue. The cast, a long one even from
the edge of the bank to which he now moved
up, was rendered difficult if not impossible by
the withies, which twice caught the tail-fly at the
beginning of the forward cast and as often
caused the Squire to give utterance to a monosyllable
delivered with staccato sharpness. At
length he succeeded in clearing the withies and
getting the line out to its full length. It was a
good, clean cast, and would have been perfect
had the pool been a yard wider; as it was, the
coch-y-bondhu caught in the rushes and, despite
the coaxing treatment to which the Squire
subjected it, refused to come away, the only
result being to alarm the hare and raise the ire
of the angler. Worse was to come; for presently
the trout, which kept rising with irritating persistence,
seized the dropper, hooked itself, and
in the violent struggle that followed broke the
tackle and got away with the red palmer in its
jaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation was beyond the power of words,
and it was strange to see how the Squire met
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
it. He dashed the rod to the ground, he paced
up and down the bank like a man demented, he
shook his fist at the withies, he shook it at the
rushes, and kept shaking it till at length, after
having beaten a path on the turf, he had worked
off his rage. Then he sat down on the bank,
filled his pipe and blew clouds of smoke. The
tobacco had a soothing effect: soon he was
debating with himself whether to break the cast
or go and release the hook. He resolved to go
round, but first he would try to free it where he
sat. So he took up the rod, flicked the line, and
then, as bad luck would have it, the fly came
away. Yes, it was bad luck, for few things
would have surprised and delighted the Squire
more than the sight of a hare, whom he must
have disturbed had he been compelled to go
round. He would have been thrilled by the
discovery that the hare was not, as he believed,
extinct on his land. But it was a joy postponed;
he was to see the hare before the year was
out, in circumstances as different from those as
imagination can conceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And meanwhile the hare, whose immunity
from molestation had been remarkable, was
destined to undergo a series of terrible trials,
the first of which, strangely enough, befell it
that very night.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>CHASED BY POLECATS</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had sunk below the hill, and Golden
Valley lay in shadow and repose. Zekiah, the
miller<a id='mill2'></a>, his work done at last, sat smoking his
pipe on the bench by the door; the mill-wheel
was at rest, and the stream was slowly refilling
the nearly emptied pond where, from time to
time, a wave in the shallows betrayed the
movement of a trout. Overhead a few swifts
yet wheeled: but yellow-hammer, whinchat,
blackcap, whitethroat, and long-tailed tit had
sought roosting-places in the furze, and the
magpie that haunted the mill had withdrawn
to his perch in the hawthorn. For them the
hour for rest had come; the moment when
nocturnal creatures quit their retreat drew near.
The bat was on the point of leaving the crevice
under the eaves; the owl<a id='owl'></a> in the ivied scarp, the
vixen in the earth overlooking the fowling-pool
watched the shadows deepen, and still more
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
impatient was the leveret, who already after a
two nights’ absence was longing for a feast of
clover. With the peeping of the stars he
sprang from the form, leapt the stream at the
inflow, and gaining the crest of the hill, made
over the upland almost straight as a crow flies
for his destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in the highest of spirits; the nearer
he came to the field the more determined he was
to show fight to the rabbits should they combine
to drive him from it. The thought never entered
his head that any other creatures would intervene
between him and his feast, much less that before he
could reach the feeding-ground he would be turned
into a terror-stricken fugitive; yet so it proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On, on he sped until he reached the pasture
adjoining the clover; he was within a stone’s
throw of the gate when he heard the patter of
feet on the other side of the hedge; his curiosity
was aroused, and he stood still to see the creatures
pass the gap a dozen yards to his rear. He
expected to view a troop of rats, of which he had
met many in the standing corn; to his horror it
proved to be a family of <a id='pole3'></a>polecats, moving so
slowly in single file that, though there were only
six in all, he thought the procession would never
come to an end. All peered through the gap;
the last actually stopped and scrutinised the
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
leveret, but concluding that he was one of the
many stones that littered the ground, galloped off
after the others. It was a narrow escape, for had
the leveret raised head or ears he must have been
recognised and have drawn the bloodthirsty crew
upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of the polecats had so frightened
him that he was incapable of movement; it was
some minutes before he had sufficiently recovered
to continue on his way. Near the gate he
stopped and looked back, and once more after
entering the field, but without seeing a sign of
the enemy. Then he cast his eyes vaguely
over the field, the goal of his longing. Not a
rabbit was to be seen; the patch of uncut
clover looked most tempting. Did he hasten
to nibble the succulent leaves? Not at all: he
never went near them; he moved away, urged
by the impulse to put as great a distance
as possible between himself and the polecats,
for he felt sure they would follow his trail.
All at once he broke into a panic-stricken
flight, and kept it up as far as the barley-field,
which had been cut in his absence. On the
hedge by the tit’s deserted nest he stood and
listened with ears erect. He expected to hear
the whimpering chorus that he had once heard in
the valley below, the cry that would confirm his
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
fears. But there was no sound, not even a
slight rustling of the medlar leaves. The
silence, however, brought him no comfort. It
could not dispel the dread which kept him
wandering aimlessly about the oatfield like a
thing awaiting its doom; so that he must have
wasted half an hour before leaving by the gate
at the lower corner and galloping across the
long meadow where some bullocks glared at
him as he sped past. In the small enclosure
beyond he stopped to nibble one of the turnips
growing there, but so nervous was he that the
pigeon drinking at the woodland pool does not
raise its head more often than he. His eyes
are directed to the spot on the hedge where he
had passed; for he is sure that the polecats
before now have struck his trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His apprehension proved correct. The polecats
had happened on his line amongst the
furze above the mill-pool, and run it in the
right direction from the first. More than once
the mother, conscious of the wide circuit made
by a hare, was on the point of abandoning the
trail; but the sight of her kittens revelling
in the scent got the better of her judgment
and induced her to keep on. She led her
young at the utmost speed they were capable
of maintaining, arresting her steps only to scan
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
each field she came to, in the hope of seeing
and being seen by the hare, who she knew
would be paralysed at the sight of her. She
never dreamt that the hare had already seen
her and was under the spell of her influence;
though the knowledge could not have hastened
the pursuit, inasmuch as the kittens were
hurrying on as fast as their legs could carry
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distance that separated the hunters from
the quarry was not great. When they entered
the clover the leveret was only just leaving the
oats; when they were crossing the barley stubble
he was still nibbling the turnips; but he gained
after that. For while the polecats were busy
working out the tortuous line in the oats he
forged ahead and gained High Down, where he
busied himself in laying a most intricate maze.
He moved hither and thither criss-crossing the
trail incessantly, knowing that his life depended
on its intricacy. It was well that he was
thoroughly absorbed in his task, for had he
stopped and listened he could hardly have failed
to hear the shrill cry of his pursuers as they
bounded across the long meadow. On gaining
the hedge-top they stood scrutinising the rows
of turnips as if they expected to see the game
there; and very odd they looked standing side
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
by side on their hind legs, their eyes shining like
glow-worms. But the quarry was nowhere to
be seen, so presently mother and kittens leapt
to the ground and resumed the full cry,
which they kept up over the undulating field
beyond, round the edge of the swamp, and
below the pair of haggard thorns between which
the pack passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the leveret, his task well done, was
on the point of leaving the downs. He was
perhaps a score yards from the gate when the
cry he had been so long expecting fell on his
ears and rendered him all but helpless. Some
hares would have lain down and awaited their
fate; others would have squealed and hastened
it; but the leveret’s courage was high, and, stifling
the cry which sought for utterance, he battled
as best he could against the paralysing weakness
that assailed him, and dragged himself yard by
yard towards the gate. Suddenly the cry ceased:
the polecats had come on the maze, and in silence
devoted themselves to the business of unravelling
it. With the cessation of the blood-curdling
chorus the leveret’s power gradually returned;
he drew farther and farther away, seemingly all
uncertain as to his goal. At one moment he
headed for the form on the hedge; at another
for the mound where he had sat once or twice
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
when the wind was northerly; but in the end
he set his face for the form by the pool, and to
this direction he kept. The polecats, maddened
by the delay, had been displaying a feverish
energy in their attempt to discover the true
line. Each worked independently of the other,
and not a kitten looked to the mother for
guidance. Theirs was indeed a difficult task:
no pack of harriers would have accomplished it
without aid of man; yet the wildlings, with a
persistence that would not be denied, after two
hours’ search succeeded in recovering the line
by which the leveret had left the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strangely enough the discovery was made by
the smallest of the litter, who, after raising the
cry of “found,” sat on his haunches and gazed
about him, as if he expected to view the game.
He continued to sit even after his mother had
taken up the trail, but presently fell into his
place at the end of the long file and joined in
the full-tongued chorus. Increased speed now
marked the pursuit. The pack was running
for blood, and running as they knew against
<a id='time'></a>time, for night was yielding to the grey dawn.
Already the cocks were crowing, and soon a
farm boy was heard calling the cows. At other
times the polecats would have stopped, perhaps
slunk away to cover; now they gave no heed,
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
no more indeed than to the ruddy sky that
told of the coming sun. True that, save for
the occasional cry of a kitten, they had ceased
their whimperings; otherwise they behaved as
if it were the dead of night, going from corner
to corner of even the biggest fields, and when at
last they came to the mill-lane, following it with
a daring that wild creatures rarely display.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miller’s wife caught sight of the polecat
as it leapt from the wall, and then watched the
spring of kitten after kitten till she was almost
tongue-tied with amazement. At last she
screamed out: “Zekiah, Zekiah, there’s a passel
of fitchers under the window; they’re running
something, I’m sure they are. Wust ’ee, jump
out and mob them, thee lie-abed, they’ll take
no notice of a woman.” Whereupon the miller
sprang out of bed, thrust his head through
the open window, and shouted: “Ah, you bold,
imprent varmints, ah! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you stinking old
night-trade. Be off wi’ ’ee. Ah! ah! ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heedless of the rating, the pack made for
the bank of the pool and found another maze
awaiting them there. This discouraged the
kittens, as their movements showed. But their
mother knew that this maze was the hare’s last
ruse, that he was squatting near; and surely
she must have communicated this knowledge
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
to her young, or why should they have suddenly
thrown off their lethargy and displayed the
almost fiendish activity they did? In an instant
the bank was alive with their undulating forms.
They darted in and out amongst the sedge;
they swam the ditch and twisted about amongst
the stems of the withies; again and again
they gathered at the spot where the Squire
had first stood to fish; for from there the
leveret, by a long leap, had gained the pool
and swum to the opposite bank. It was the
sheet of water that had decided him to make
for the form amidst the rushes, and there he
was sitting, motionless and helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily he could see nothing of the black,
restless creatures, not even their arched backs
or raised heads; but the smell of their rank
bodies polluted the air, so he knew they were
there defiling with their presence the sweet tranquillity
of the scene. The absence of all trace
of scent near the water, however, baffled the
polecats. They could not trace the hare beyond
the take-off place, and the clouded water where
he had stirred the mud in the shallows contained
no message for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The growing light was beginning to cause
uneasiness to the band; nevertheless one of
them proceeded to draw the farther bank; it
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
was the tiny fellow who had recovered the line
on High Down. Twice he approached the edge
of the pool as if he intended to swim to the other
side, but withdrew, made along the bank, crossed
at the inflow and at once began questing amongst
the rushes. Nearer and nearer he came to the
helpless prey, was indeed close on it when the
<a id='mag3'></a>magpie, returning to the thorn by the withies,
espied him and forthwith set up the most
irritating and persistent chatter. The polecat
was greatly disconcerted by the mobbing of the
bird, and presently, unable to endure the insults
longer, leapt at it where it fluttered just beyond
his reach. Maddened by failure he kept on
springing at the black-and-white pest till he came
to the hatch, up which he climbed to the cross-piece
and, careless of both hare and bird, sat
there listening to the <a id='mill3'></a>miller, who was now
abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The footfall of the miller and the noise he
made in pulling the faggots out of the furze-rick
caused the <a id='pole'></a>polecat little disquietude; but the
moment Zekiah began whistling “Pop goes the
Weasel,” he leapt to the sward and bounded after
his mother, already in full retreat with the rest
of the litter, towards a deserted quarry where she
had decided to pass the rest of the day.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span><h1><a id='c05'></a>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>A DELUSIVE REFUGE</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night after that terrible chase the hare
made his way back to the farm; but there he
met only fresh troubles. First he was driven
from <a id='gard2'></a>Johanna’s Garden by a man cutting the
hedge, and compelled to slink away in a blaze
of sunshine, which was torture to him; next,
when sitting in the clover he was pestered by a
yearling, that kept rubbing him with her nose.
Despite the buffeting he gave her, she annoyed
him so much that in the end he had no choice
but to get up and steal away to the cabbage-pile.
A week later he was driven from this retreat by
old Betty, who came and cut the very cabbage
that sheltered him. Thereupon he returned to
the seat on the hedge, and continued to use it
until one morning he found a weasel curled up
there. Then he forsook it for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when considering where he should
pass the coming day, his thoughts, as always in
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
time of worry, turned to the hill, and at the
approach of dawn, instead of heading for the
farm, he set his face for <a id='chap2'></a>Chapel Carn Brea. He
was quite elated at the prospect of returning
to the familiar upland; he even made up his
mind where to sit; yet all came to nothing,
for when he was a mile on the way another
retreat won his favour and turned him from his
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he skirted the large pool on the Land’s
End moor his ever alert eyes fell on the tiny
island in its midst; immediately there flashed on
his mind an idea of the immunity from molestation
such a retreat would afford. There, with
the water around him, he felt that he would be
safer than anywhere else; that neither fox nor
cat, polecat nor weasel, would disturb him, nor
man intrude; in short, that the <a id='islet'></a>islet offered the
sanctuary he had often longed for and hitherto
sought in vain. But there was one disadvantage,
and a most serious one—the apparent
impossibility of reaching the island without swimming.
He knew from his experience at the
mill-pool that no amount of shaking could dry
a wet coat sufficiently to make sitting in it
endurable for a whole day; and because of this
he was on the point of abandoning the project
and continuing his way, when, on second thoughts,
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
prompted by the low state of the water, he
decided to try whether he could reach the island
by wading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After looking round to see that he was not
observed, he entered the pool and made straight
for a rock where he meant to land before attempting
to gain his goal, which lay just beyond it.
But the water was soon so deep that at
every step he dreaded finding himself out of
his depth. Nevertheless, he was able to keep
touch of the bottom until within some ten
yards of the rock: there suddenly he had to
rear on his hind legs to prevent his shoulders
from being submerged. Most hares in this
situation would have wheeled round and made
for shore; but the jack was not so easily
thwarted. A difficult situation called forth his
resource: before you could count three, so quick
was he to act, he was advancing on his hind
legs over the rough bed, and he actually succeeded
in gaining the rock without wetting more
than a few inches of his coat. He stood a
moment on the rock to shake the water from
his chest and belly, then examined the strait
between him and the island. It was far too
deep to bottom, apparently far too wide to cross
by a standing leap. But he meant to try.
The worst that could befall him was a good
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
drenching and the consequent abandonment of
his plan. Twice he gathered himself to spring;
as often he drew back; he was not satisfied
with the hold of his front feet. A third time he
gathered his strong hind limbs well under him,
got a firm grip of the rock with his fore
pads, launched himself with all the force he
was capable of, and landed high and dry with
a few inches to spare. After surveying his
refuge, he leapt to the spot he had selected for
his seat, and squatting close to the ground with
his ears pressed close on his back, was indistinguishable
from his surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden disappearance of the animal
which an instant before had been so very conspicuous
was little short of magical; even when
the sun rose it was difficult to pick him out,
so happily did his colouring blend with the
russet of the fern and the gold and grey of the
lichens. One thing alone betrayed him, his
eyes: they were wide open, maintaining their
unbroken watch. For months they had kept
vigil on cornfield, pasturage, and the enclosing
hedges; now they scanned a waste of sullen
mere and barren moor without sign of life save
a wheatear<a id='wheat'></a> flitting from stack to stack of the
turf that dotted the heathery ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A harmless intruder was this frail bird;
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
equally harmless the seagulls which came almost
daily to drink and bathe and preen their plumage.
At times the islet was ringed with their elegant
forms: they might have been taken for the bodyguard
of the hare, if there had been anything
to suggest danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawn after dawn the hare stole back to
his island retreat, where after awhile he began
to throw aside his ordinary precautions and to
relax his vigilance, passing the day in careless
content. One noon he even grew so reckless
as to abandon his usual wakeful position and
rest on his side, with head and ears erect, his
hind legs stretched out to their full length, and
the white underfur exposed in a way that would
have betrayed him to any prying eyes. The
following day, soothed by the hot sun and
the ripple against the bank, he actually fell so
soundly asleep as to be insensible to his surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, he was soon to be rudely apprised of
the insecurity of his refuge, which was in fact
an ancient holt of the otters that visited the
pool. The awakening came on the nineteenth
day in this wise. He was just back in the form
casting his restless eyes about him as usual,
when he saw something rise to the surface of
the mere and almost instantly sink from view.
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
The grey light and a mist prevented him
from seeing clearly; yet he knew that it was
an <a id='otter2'></a>otter. At once he became alarmed for his
safety, because he felt almost sure that the
intruder would seek the island to couch on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was on the point of obeying his instinct to
steal away whilst there was yet time, but irresolution
held him back. He half rose; he resettled
himself; he wavered again, and finally decided to
await the issue. There he sat, watching and
hoping that the creature would seek harbourage
in the reeds beyond the spot where he had seen
it. Minutes passed without a sign, he thought
that his hopes were realised; he had almost
ceased to scan the pool, when to his dismay the
otter rose with a snort within a few yards, and
lay motionless with his black bead-like eyes fixed
on the island. It was a trying moment for the
hare; had he moved ever so slightly the otter
must have seen him, but he remained as rigid
as the rock beside him; even his nostrils were at
rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, shaking the water out of her ears,
the otter dived, only, however, to reappear with
an eel in her mouth and land where the only
creek on the islet had often invited her. Scarcely
more than her length from the hare she lay
down at full length with her head towards the
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
water, and, holding the prey firmly between her
fore paws, proceeded to devour it. Her wet
coat gleamed when the sun rose across the
level waste marking moor and pool with the
shadows of the turf-stacks, yet the otter took
no notice of the unfriendly rays; she was too
much engrossed with her prey. Once she looked
up, but no noise had attracted her; the slicing
and champing of the flesh by her sharp white
teeth was the only sound of that hushed hour.
When she had eaten part of the fish, she
dropped the remainder, advanced a few inches
into the water and washed her muzzle with her
great splayed foot, interrupting her ablutions
to listen momentarily to the faint echo raised
by a train of pack-mules<a id='mule'></a>. Then she returned
to the islet and rolled on the fern. Now this
way, now that, the long sleek creature turned
and twisted, approaching dangerously near
the little knoll against which the hare was
pressed so close as to look scarcely more than
half his size. At last, having dried her coat,
she sought a clump of osmunda some five
lengths from the hare, coiled herself up, and
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now again there was an opportunity for the
hare to steal away: surely he would take
advantage of it. But no; rather than run the
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
risk of awakening the otter and being pursued,
he decided to wait till twilight should call his
enemy away and leave the way clear for him to
effect his escape. So he sat watching the flank
of the otter rise and fall, his gaze never shifting,
even when a cormorant rose close to the island
and looked at him with its green eyes before
resuming its fishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the otter lay unconscious of the
presence of the bird; but towards sundown the
scream of a gull, and again soon after, the croak
of a <a id='rave'></a>raven caused her suddenly to stir and scan
the moor in order to satisfy herself that there
was no cause for alarm. A glance telling her
that all was well, she immediately lowered her
head and dropped off again. The raven that
had alighted close to the pool remained till near
roosting time, and then flew away in the direction
of the cliffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird was still in sight when an altogether
unlooked-for intruder arrived. An old
man with a dog at his heels came on the
moor driving two donkeys to fetch turf; whilst
he was loading the panniers from one of the
stacks the terrier trotted to the pool to drink.
There he hit the scent left by the otter at dawn.
In an instant he was all excitement; being as
intelligent as he was keen-nosed, he concluded
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
that the otter must be lying on the island, and
his one thought was to get at it. He entered
the water and struck out as fast as he could
swim. The otter, startled out of her sleep by
a shout from the man, was at once on the alert,
and when the dog drew near she slipped into
the water; but the dog had seen her. Then a
strange thing happened; the cormorant chancing
to rise in the line of pursuit, the terrier took up
the chase of the bird as if ignorant of the
change of quarry. His master of course recalled
him; he swam to shore; and immediately
he landed, the otter, who was watching from
the reeds, returned to the island, reaching it in
one long dive. She landed at the creek as before,
and crouching through the fern stole towards
her lair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had taken but a step or two when
she suddenly stopped, and turning her mask
examined the ground to her left. She had
caught the scent of the hare; she knew he
was close by, and she was doing her utmost to
descry him. She looked here, she looked there,
and at last, as she was about to advance, she
made him out. On the instant she sank slowly
to the ground; she feared that quick movement
on her part would put the prey to flight before
she was free to pursue, for her shy nature
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
restrained her from exposing herself to view of
man and dog. So there she stayed, eyeing
the timid prey which met her gaze with a
frightened stare. Presently the man left with
his donkeys. Now surely the otter would try
and secure the prize. But no, she was in no
hurry; the sun would soon be down, then she
would secure him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that tense interval the hare again rehearsed,
as he had done half a score times since
he had been face to face with his enemy, the
steps of his escape. The first leap he reckoned
would land him on the far side of the islet, the
next on the rock, a third in the water, on recollection
of the depth of which he endured the
agonies of a nightmare as in imagination he
saw the ferocious brute overtaking him while
he floundered; but the feeling passed, leaving
him as undaunted as ever and determined to
make a supreme effort to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this the sun approached the level of the
moor; the gulls had left; the cormorant, which
had stood and dried its wings on the rock, flew
low over the lurid surface of the pool, looking
black as the raven against the crimson disc:
the actors in the impending tragedy were left
absolutely alone. Soon, less than half the great
orb remained above the horizon; in a few
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
minutes, which seemed as many hours to the
hare, it had sunk to the merest arc; then it
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the instant that the hare awaited;
the otter knew it, and the hare saw that she
knew it; the sudden gathering of her limbs
proclaimed it. With a tremendous bound he
was off, with the otter in hot pursuit. It was
a close chase; for though the hare gained the
rock a good ten feet ahead of the otter and
increased his lead to fully fifteen at his next
spring, the water, as he had foreseen, impeded
his further progress so much that he seemed to
be at the mercy of his swiftly advancing enemy.
What floundering, what splashing by the hare!
What ploughing of the water by the otter in
her desperate haste! Foot by foot she gained
till at last her nose all but touched his hind
legs. It looked as if she must seize him; so
she would have done but for a timely rock
which gave the hare the foothold he needed.
The spring he made from it was one of the
longest of his life; it landed him well on to the
shallows; two more leaps and he was on the
heather, over which he sped like the wind.
How good the herbage felt under his feet!
Further pursuit was vain; yet the otter,
maddened at the loss of the prey she had
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
accounted hers, held on at her best speed to the
corner of the pool before checking her steps to
watch the hare. He stood awhile and returned
her gaze. Then he shook his coat and resumed
his way over the darkening moor.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span><h1><a id='c06'></a>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>BACK ON CARN BREA</p>

<p class='pindent'>On leaving the moor the hare headed as if to
return to Tregonebris, but in the dip below the
stone-circle he suddenly changed his course and
made straight for Brea. He had that instant
formed the resolve to forage on the farm there
and to harbour afterwards on his native hill.
His panic pace, even more the staring eyes
turned ever behind him, bespoke his nervous condition;
but the farther he went the more composed
he grew, and he was almost his normal
self by the time he reached his destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There he roamed in search of food from pasture
to pasture, wondering to see the change
that had come over them since his early leveret
days. Then the corn and the grass rose high
above his head; he recalled how he had stood on
his hind legs and looked over the array of ears;
now there was not herbage enough to cover
his pads. But despite the nakedness of the enclosures
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
he experienced no sense of strangeness:
the bushes on the hedges, the gates, the gaps
and the linhay in the field beyond the old
mine-heaps were the same as ever. He remembered
them all, even the hole in the wall of
the three-cornered enclosure; and through this,
in the small hours, he squeezed his way to the
turnip-field that runs like a narrow promontory
into the waste. The sight of the turnips gladdened
his eyes, for he had gleaned little on
the closely browsed grass-land and was very
hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He at once pared the rind from one of the
roots and began feasting on the succulent pulp.
The stars shone bright, the fleecy clouds moved
slowly, and the light wind scarcely breathed a
sigh on the open waste where some curlews
were whistling. The hare took no notice of
their calls, but at the startled cry of a plover
he at once sprang to the top of the wall, to
learn, if he could, what had disturbed it. He
scanned the face of the moor carefully without
seeing any sign of a marauder, so at length returned
to the half-eaten root and consumed it
without further interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was nearly gone before he withdrew,
not following the way he had come, but
leaping the wall and crossing the corner of
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
the moor to the partly-upturned field. Here
a plough in the furrow caught his eye and caused
him to swerve from his path. Yet suspicious
as he was of the plough he passed close to a
bucket of mushrooms in the Five Acres, where
he stood on a mound to gaze at the silent
homestead and at <a id='chap3'></a>Carn Brea before he set off
for the hill. Then, as though the fading stars
warned him of the need to hurry, he went at
so brisk a pace that the noise of his pads on
the bridle-track sounded quite distinct in the
stillness of the dawn. At the foot of the long
slope he quickly laid his maze; he threaded his
way up and up past the Pilgrim’s Spring almost
to the chantry, and chose a seat amongst the
bracken within a few yards of the spot where
he was born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five months had passed since he sat there,
but he felt quite at home. As the light grew,
the outlook commanded a well-remembered prospect,
albeit the vegetation had greatly changed.
His young eyes had beheld it fresh and green;
now all was sere and tinted with the colours
of decay. Yet the herbage thus blended so
wondrously with the russet of his coat that
he was not to be distinguished from his surroundings.
He seemed a part of the rich
mantle which draped the giant shoulders of
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
the hill down to the very verge of the farm,
where all was grey and sombre save the bright
gold of the sycamore by the dairy window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the farmer crossed the yard to
the shed for the oxen and drove them along
the lane to the half-ploughed field, followed by
the watchful gulls, which came flying in from
the cliffs in such numbers that the long furrow
in the wake of the plough was soon white with
their forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare was an interested spectator of all
this movement; indeed everything that moved
claimed his notice; not a leaf of the sycamore
fell but it caught his eye. Stirred by association,
old memories, too, came flocking back;
once more he was a tiny leveret listening to
the whispered monition of his mother, “Sit still,
dears, till I come back”; once more he was
sitting beside his little sister hearkening to
the voices of the night that always died away
before the footfall of their mother broke the silence
of the dawn and set their hearts aflutter with
delight. Then, though he strove to repress all
sinister recollections, he rehearsed the visit of
the vixen; a glint of the pool on the distant
moor called up the horrors of the previous
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most trifling incident diverted his
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
attention; soon he was occupied in watching a
red admiral which had settled on a bramble leaf
and kept opening and shutting its gorgeous
wings, as if for his distraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So hour after hour passed in the warm light
that bathed the hill and touched with a velvety
softness even the old chantry and the granite
boulders, till at length the sun sank behind the
sea, leaving plain and upland to the mystery of
night and the glories of the full moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day was the harbinger of a lovely St
Martin’s <a id='summer'></a>summer, during which the hare greatly
enjoyed sitting on the hill and wandering over
the lowland. It would have been a perfect time
but for the abundance of the gossamers; they
floated from every blade and spray and clung
to his legs and chest, even to his face, causing
him much annoyance. He was very nice as to
his person; he could not rest unless his coat was
free of everything that adhered to it, and it was
a tedious business getting rid of the gossamer
threads; indeed, it took him so long that he
had to return earlier than usual so as to finish
the grooming before daybreak, lest the movement
of his pads and tongue, which served as
brushes and sponge, should betray him to his
enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The welcome after-summer lasted a full fortnight,
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
and was abruptly terminated by <a id='fog'></a>sea-fogs,
that came rolling in from the Atlantic and
enveloped the land as with a dense pall. Much
as the hare had disliked the gossamer webs he
disliked the fog still more, not only because it
shut out the view and the light of the sun and
the moon, but—what was much more serious—because
it afforded cover to the foxes, who
moved about as fearlessly by day as by night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These prowlers became a positive trouble;
scarcely a day passed but at least one went
by; amongst them a big <a id='grey'></a>grey fox, whom he had
never seen before, but of whom he was to
see more than he liked in the terrible winter
that followed. Yet close as these marauders
approached the seats, they never discovered the
hare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, the time of chief danger was the
night. He was abroad then, but it was impossible
to see more than a few yards ahead,
so that once he almost ran into the farm cat
in the mushroom field; two nights later he
brushed close past a badger that was stretching
itself against the upright of a cromlech. However,
no harm ensued; for the hare leapt aside
and was lost to sight in the fog as effectually as
if he had been covered with a mass of cotton
wool.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
He got glimpses of other animals in his
wanderings, though so vaguely that he failed to
identify them. Moreover in the strange conditions
the hare himself sometimes proved a
terror to creatures he stumbled on, causing a
<a id='hedge'></a>hedgehog to curl up in affright on the Five
Acres, and scaring a heron out of its senses
on the moor beyond. The fog was as impervious
to scent as to sight, and he was on his victims
before they heard him, for the fog deadened
all sound, of footfall, of bird cry, even of the
great foghorn on the <a id='long2'></a>Longships, which sounded
like a penny trumpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all the ills attendant on those ceaseless
mists, the one which caused the hare most
discomfort was the moisture that collected
on the herbage and dripped on his back as
he sat in the form. Two days he endured the
misery; then he left the comfortable seat for
the shelter of the fallen masonry of the chantry,
and sat cheek by jowl with an enormous <a id='toad'></a>toad
who resented his company till he got to understand
and like him.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth day, however, that the hare
saw the great bank of fog come moving landwards
from the sea, to the joy of man and
beast an easterly wind set in which banished
the fog and dried the sodden herbage, rendering
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
the form habitable again. It was a keen,
biting wind, but the hare felt no inconvenience.
One sign of the cold snap was the red shawl
in which the farmer’s wife rode to market;
another, quite as unmistakable, was the advent
of the <a id='cock'></a>woodcock, whom the hare found sitting
near the seat two days later. The stranger
was unlike any bird he had seen; it had rich
brown plumage beautifully pencilled, a very
long bill, and soft black eyes which looked fearlessly
into his. The hare, unobservant though
he usually was of such matters, could not
help seeing that it was very jaded and weary;
and weary it might well be, for it had but
just accomplished its long flight from Heligoland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days before it had harboured in its
native forest by the Baltic, awaiting the fall of
night to begin its journey to the unfrozen West.
When the moon showed above the ghostly
steppe, the bird had risen over the snow-laden
pine-tops and, mounting to a great height in
company with a score others, set out for the
hospitable land beyond the seas. The wind
was favourable; bight, lagoon, and island marked
the way, till the glimmer given out by a lighthouse—a
glimmer that grew brighter and
brighter—told that their mid-journey resting-place
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
had been reached. They hid till night;
then they rose again and resumed their flight
beneath the starry vault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sound of earth reached the high region
where they moved; their own faint wing-beats
alone broke the silence through which hour after
hour the wedge-shaped line pressed on till the
vast silvery ocean that had lain outspread beneath
them gave place to a sombre plain relieved only
by the glow-worm light emitted by town and
city far below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon as remembered haunts were reached
the little flock began to break up: now one, now
two, and after a long interval, four birds forsook
the line; others followed, so that when a
second ocean showed on either side the narrowing
land, only three remained. But the little
remnant still sped on, nearer and nearer to their
destination at the end of the promontory. Two
dropped into <a id='gold2'></a>Golden Valley, and the remaining
woodcock reached <a id='chap4'></a>Carn Brea alone. Little
wonder, then, that he was very tired; yet so
soon did he recover from his fatigue that when
dusk fell he rose without an effort, and, skimming
the slope, passed over Brea Farm and the
now empty turnip-field to the boggy feeding-ground
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daybreak found hare and woodcock back in
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
their places on the hill; and for three days they
kept company there, or rather till the afternoon
of the third day, when the wind veered back
to the old quarter, beating with such violence
on the face of Carn Brea that the hare could
not endure it, and stole to sheltered quarters on
the southern flank of the hill. There, with his
back to a furze-bush, he sat watching the
withered grasses of the foothills swept by the
<a id='hurr'></a>hurricane and the low wrack driven past close
overhead. The wind fell at sundown, but
rose again later and blew with such vehemence
that the hare, who was foraging at Boscawen-Un,
could scarcely make headway against it. Once
he was actually brought to a standstill, and
when crossing Brahan Moor on his way back
it was all he could do to keep his feet. By
the time he got to the form he was so wearied
out by the incessant buffeting that whilst
listening to the shriek and sob of the wind
he fell asleep, and—a thing he rarely did—dreamt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his dream he saw as if with his eyes, so
vivid was the presentment, a wood devastated by
storm; at its foot—for the trees covered a
long declivity—a curving strand and a raging
sea in which living things struggled to reach
the shore. Night changed suddenly to day: as
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
suddenly the scene changed from falling trees
and breaking waves to wind-swept foothills, up
which, nose to ground, a brindled <a id='lurch'></a>lurcher ran
with incredible swiftness—and the foothills were
the foothills below him, the lurcher was the farm
dog from <a id='bosc'></a>Boscawen-Un; the trail it followed
was his own trail. His wide-open eyes beheld
every twist and turn of the dog’s advance without
suggesting danger, till the enemy was almost
within springing distance; then consciousness
returned, and at a bound the affrighted creature
cleared the bush and fled up the hill. He soon
outdistanced his pursuer, fleet-footed though she
was, reached the crest, swerved and ran with
the gale at his back till within sight of <a id='caer2'></a>Caer
Bran. After coming so far he wished to satisfy
himself that the dog still pursued. The wind
lashed his face and beat down his ears; it
threatened to blow him off the wall he stood
on; but he held his ground and looked along
his trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So had he often stood when followed by
foxes, but never once did he get a glimpse of
them: one and all recognised the uselessness
of trying to overtake him, and relinquished the
chase. He was now to learn that a dog will
persist though success seems hopeless, for soon
he saw the lurcher coming on at a pace that
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
filled him with consternation. At once he
became concerned for his safety, but not an
instant was he at a loss where to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A naked lane ran down the long slope to
<a id='boswar'></a>Boswarthen Farm, and the hare struck into it
in the hope that the gravelly track, holding
little or no scent, would render further pursuit
difficult if not impossible. The lane, which
winds considerably, ends at a gate; under this
he passed to the fields, skirted the homestead,
and finally reached <a id='gard3'></a>Johanna’s Garden, where,
after confusing the trail, he lay down in a
furrow between two ridges of the upturned
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had hopes of having defeated or disheartened
his pursuer, yet it was in a fever of
anxiety that he watched the gate under which
he himself had crept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His suspense was short, for soon to his
horror a fox-like snout and long red tongue
showed beneath the lowest bar. The next
instant the lissom beast forced her way beneath
it to the field. She at once picked up the line
and followed it to the far corner near the old
seat where the hare had leapt on the wall
and walked along the rude coping-stones before
leaping back and squatting near the medlar.
Carefully and not without difficulty the lurcher
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
followed the scent to the last of the stones,
naturally thought that the hare had gone on,
and dropped to the oat stubble, but finding no
trace of scent, recognised her mistake. Then
back she leapt to the wall, with wondrous ease
considering its height; and though she could
hardly keep her feet for the gale, she stood
there all excitement, scrutinising the ploughed
ground with eager eyes. She searched every
furrow without descrying the hare; the leaves
that whirled about him baffled her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though she failed to find him, she was so
convinced he was there that she sprang to the
ground and began questing, beginning at the
lower end and casting to and fro across the
wind in the most leisurely fashion, as if she
knew there was no occasion for hurry. She
had drawn about a third of the field when
the hare, seeing discovery was certain, slipped
from his hiding-place and, crouching very low,
stole towards the wall. He hoped to get away
unobserved, but his hope was vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as he reached the ditch the lurcher
espied him, and with a single whine started
in pursuit. Her pace down the stubble was
tremendous; she was not more than ten yards
behind the hare at the <a id='badger3'></a>badgers’ sett in the
hollow below. But on the opposing rise she
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
lost ground. By the time she came to the big
pasture where she had picked up the line at
dawn, the quarry was out of sight. She was
again running by scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the hare had won and maintained
a lead of nearly a furlong, he was beginning
to feel the strain of the chase, and anxiously
consulted with himself about his safety. Two
voices made themselves heard: the homing instinct
kept urging him to return to the hills;
the voice of self-preservation with even greater
insistence whispered, “Seek the moor, there
alone safety lies”; so towards Hal Kimbra
moor he held on and on, till at last, from a
bit of rising ground, he saw the bleak waste
stretching away before him. The fear of being
sighted and coursed on the level surface made
him shrink from crossing it: his indecision,
however, was only momentary; on looking back
and seeing no sign of his enemy, he determined
to commit himself, though not before foiling his
trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between him and the lip of the moor lay
a tract of marshy ground dotted with rushes
and coarse grasses. Here, with a view to
checking his pursuer, he leapt from tuft to
hummock and from hummock to tuft until he
had confused his line. Then he continued on
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
his way, heading for an outlying turf-stack which
stood between him and the pool. In the teeth
of the hurricane he made slow progress, but
he reached it at length, and glad of the shelter
it afforded he sat down on the lee side, facing
the ground he had just traversed. Soon
he saw the lurcher coming, and watched her
anxiously as she stood on the brow of the rising
ground scanning the moor. The moment she
set foot on the marshy ground, where she was
lost to view, he quitted his shelter and made for
the pool. Many a time he had covered the
intervening ground in a minute or two; but
the wind seemed bent on arresting his progress;
in his exhausted state all he could do
battling against it was to make headway. At
length he gained the pool, and there his heart
fell, for between him and his goal, the islet, lay
a stretch of raging water. He had not reckoned
on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a miserable creature as he sat on the
shore, looking now towards the <a id='islet2'></a>islet, now back
over the moor. He could see no hope; death
stared him in the face in both directions; yet
the instant he saw the lurcher coming he decided
to entrust himself to the pool. Strangely
enough, he did not wade in, but galloped a
score yards along the strand and then cast
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
himself into the hissing water, striking the spray
from the surface. When he rose he struck
out for his goal. He was hardly visible even
on the crests of the waves; he was completely
lost to sight when they broke over him; but
he drew nearer and nearer to the islet, and after
a terrible struggle at last landed at the otters’
creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great as was the hare’s distress, the love of
life was greater. Even in his extremity he was
careful not to betray himself by any sudden
movement to his pursuer, now at the side of the
pool. For fear of detection, he stole from the
water at a snail’s pace and, so slowly that no eye
on the shore would have been aware of any
movement, sank down on the sodden fern. There
he lay hour after hour whilst his persistent enemy
circled the pool and ransacked the waste in search
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as if she could not wrench herself
away. Once, indeed, she withdrew; but
when near the turf-stack she suddenly turned and
came back, though the gale raged more furiously
than ever. On reaching the pool, she entered the
water and stood staring at the islet. The hare
observed her with feverish anxiety; he knew
that his fate hung by a thread, and scarcely
breathed. To the dog the spray-washed rock
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
gave no sign of life whatever, yet it was long
before she abandoned this last hope and finally
withdrew. A more crestfallen creature than
she looked it would be difficult to picture; her
gait had lost all its briskness, her limbs relaxed,
her ears drooped. Her disappointment
overwhelmed her; for she had counted the
quarry hers the moment she sighted it, and on
the moor had felt absolutely certain of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare watched the retreating form of
his enemy till it became a speck and finally disappeared
from view. Then he rose, looked round
to see that no other enemy was in sight, shook
his coat, rolled where the otter had rolled, ensconced
himself in the most sheltered spot his
inhospitable refuge afforded, and there remained
till night. It was pitch dark when he withdrew
by way of the rocks he knew so well.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span><h1><a id='c07'></a>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>FROM PILLAR TO POST</p>

<p class='pindent'>With its overcast sky and sombre landscape
November opened true to its character of the
black month. The clouds seemed to have conspired
to shut out the sun; only at rare intervals
did the patient orb find a rift, but when it did
its rays lit up with intense vividness the spot
they fell on: Brea farmhouse, a bit of the moor
beyond, <a id='senn2'></a>Sennen Church tower, a patch of ocean,
the welter of surf about the <a id='wolf'></a>Wolf. To all of
these, as the shafts of light illuminated them,
the eyes of the hare were irresistibly drawn. A
week of gloom and gleam was succeeded by
a day of startling clearness, with lowland pencilled
out distinctly as on a map, a day when the
sea came so near that far-off sails and even the
unobtrusive isles<a id='scill'></a> of Scilly made their presence
felt. This phenomenon boded rain, and one
morning soon after dawn it fell, gently at first,
violently on succeeding days, with a gradual,
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
decided shifting of the wind from the north-west
to the north-east, whence at nightfall it
blew with wintry coldness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had it been a dry wind the hare would have
enjoyed its keenness, but it brought showers of
sleet which wetted him through and through,
making his days miserable. At night also these
showers greatly inconvenienced him, inasmuch
as he had to be continually shaking himself
or galloping to and fro on the moorland tracks
to keep his coat dry when he should have
been at his pasture. He disliked the sleet
more than the rain, and the hail more than
the sleet, for the stones beat in his face and eyes;
worse still, they lashed his ears and made them
burn as he sat in the form, when his body
shivered with cold from the dampness of the
underfur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this inclement time he continued to
use the seat on <a id='chap5'></a>Chapel Carn Brea, the retreat
under the drooping fronds drawing him as did
no other. True, he could have found shelter
beneath the chantry, but since lying there
he had seen Grey Fox brush close by the
opening which was the only way out; from
that moment he abandoned all idea of repairing
thither again, for fear of being cornered.
He did give a thought to the cave in Brahan
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
Croft, but could not bring himself to sit there;
to the hut by the fowling-pool and to the
linhay on Brea Farm, which presented themselves
to his mind, he had still greater objection; whilst
the rabbits’ holes which proffered their shelter
were altogether beneath his dignity, and indeed
against his nature, to which no other roof but
the sky was acceptable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he had to abandon Chapel Carn
Brea, on account of the water which lodged in
the form and rendered it untenantable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in pouring rain that the hare ransacked
the country in search of new quarters,
which he at last found in a plantation on the
western slope of <a id='creed'></a>Sancreed Beacon. On reaching
it, he remained awhile on the outskirts hesitating
to commit himself to such a strange
place, for so the <a id='beacon'></a>wood with its array of trees
seemed to him after the naked hills and barren
moorland he was alone used to. Presently,
with tremulous steps, he moved in and looked
about him for a suitable seat. In selecting
it he showed that he had his wits about him,
for the spot he chose was as free from the drippings
of the pines as any within his ken. After
scratching a slight hollow amongst the fallen
needles, he sat with his face to the hill taking
in his surroundings. No undergrowth impeded
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
his view, nothing save the stems and a tree
or two blown down by the gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He soon felt at home, for the spirit of the
place soothed him and banished the sense of
strangeness. At first the fall of a pine-cone would
startle him; by and by he took no more notice
of it than he had of the popping of the furze-pods
in the heat of August. He loved to listen
to the soughing of the wind in the lofty tops,
where the goldcrests were to be seen flitting
to and fro. He believed them to be his only
neighbours, till one night, just as he had risen,
an owl<a id='owl2'></a> came to the mouth of the hole in the next
tree and called. The cry caused him to start,
but at sight of the bird he regained his composure
and finished stretching himself; in future
if he happened to be by when the owl hooted,
he did not even trouble to look up. One
day was monotonously like another, so much so
that the visit of a woodpecker, or the arrival
of a wood-pigeon, was quite an event. Small
wonder then that the hare, with his hermit-like
tastes, felt happy in this peaceful solitude, and
soon abandoned all thought of the intruders
his imagination had conjured up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, before many more dawns had broken, the
wood was visited by a pine-marten<a id='mar'></a>, a dangerous
marauder, who resembled the hare in this respect
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
that she too was the sole survivor of her kind.
She came early; the stars had hardly begun to
pale when, with scarcely a rustle to announce
her coming, the hare saw her making as
straight towards him as the trees permitted. Indeed,
she threatened to overrun him, but stopped
a dozen yards away near a patch of gaudy
orange-red fungus, and sat scratching an ear till
a shout from the glebe farm suddenly arrested
her attention. At the sound she stood erect
and listened with ears acock. She was an
elegant creature with a bushy tail, resembling,
save for her dark-brown colouring, a dwarf fox;
and, like reynard himself, the moment she was
satisfied that the shout, twice repeated, was not
the hue and cry that had pursued her again and
again, she relaxed her tense attitude and fell to
play. She ran with bewitching grace and
activity along the trunk and branches of a fallen
tree, rested at the end of the longest branch,
and, after brushing a feather from her muzzle,
renewed her frolics, as if for the hare’s entertainment.
Then back she jumped to the ground,
sprang to the nearest bole, climbed up and up,
was plainly visible at the dome against the now
reddening sky, and finally lay at full length
on a horizontal branch scanning the scene
below. Her quick eyes were everywhere—now
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
on the jackdaws astir on the church tower, now
on a labourer faring to work, now, as the light
grew, on the vessels wind-bound under St
Michael’s Mount, and presently on the sun
when its bright face showed above the <a id='liz'></a>Lizard
and laid a golden pathway across the waters of
<a id='bay'></a>the bay. Soon the rays fired the pine-tops,
and turned to brightest crimson the tongue
of the marten as she licked her glossy forelegs
and buff-coloured breast. When she had
finished grooming herself she lay awhile with her
head between her paws, blinking and enjoying
the genial warmth that dried her coat, and
at last sought the deserted hawk’s nest in the
fork, where she had often curled up during her
forays.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='mart'></a>Her fastness was in the <a id='end2'></a>Land’s End cliffs.
Never was castle wall so stately or so majestic
as the mural face of the precipice that furnished
her a refuge some thirty feet above the Atlantic,
whose roar was her lullaby.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There she slept away most of the hours
between grey dawn and night. Awakened either
by the scream of homing seafowl or by the
level rays penetrating her lair, she watched
through the narrow portal of her retreat the
sun set, the glow die out of the west, and
darkness spread over the face of the waters,
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
before sallying forth to execute the raid she
had planned. She was the wiliest of marauders,
pilfering here to-night, elsewhere to-morrow,
and, save that she avoided <a id='bosc2'></a>Boscawen-Un—the
lurcher’s home—ranging in all directions. She
took toll of seafowl on the dizzy ledge, she
robbed the farmers’ henroosts and beehives,
she stripped the squire’s strawberry beds and
plundered the crabber’s bait, hang it where he
might. Few places were inaccessible to her;
she was as much at home on the crags of the
<a id='kitec'></a>Kites’ <a id='cairn'></a>Carn as on the loftiest pine of Sancreed
Beacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wonder that those quick eyes of
hers had not descried the hare, but probably
that was owing to the shouts which distracted
her attention just as her gaze was being directed
towards the spot where he sat motionless. As
for the hare his eyes never left the strange
creature. Her character he had read at sight.
He read it in the feather on the muzzle, the
blood-stain on the whiskers, and above all in
the apprehension she showed on hearing the
shout. To his view that was an infallible sign
of a felon. He was glad when she ascended
the tree and the length of the long stem
separated them, for he believed that the marten
had seen him and might have pounced on him
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
at any moment. As he was far from being
assured that she would not attempt to get at
him before the day was out, he made a point of
keeping awake and on the look-out for sign
of movement in the eyrie between him and
the blue vault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Higher and higher rose the sun, flooding the
hill with light, warming the resinous trees and
filling the wood with their fragrance. But for
the cold nip in the air it might almost have
been a summer’s day. One less suggestive of
evil happening could not be; yet the first act
of a tragedy of which the wood was to be the
theatre was being enacted less than a furlong
away, where two <a id='wease2'></a>weasels were pressing a
<a id='rabb2'></a>rabbit from gallery to gallery of its burrow.
No hope for the defenceless thing lay there,
still less in the wood across which it presently
came loping with fateful laboured movement. A
look of entreaty appeared in the rabbit’s starting
eyes when it saw the hare, but the doomed
creature did not stop. On, on it struggled,
followed still by the murderers, the two puny,
lithe, fiendish-looking weasels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of these bloodthirsty miscreants
stirred the hare to fury; scarcely had they
passed when he rose and stamped with his
hind feet: surely not to warn his own kind, it
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
could not be that; it was his protest, his poor,
ineffectual protest, against the outrage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Intent on their quarry, the weasels gave no
heed, but the owl looked out of its hole to
learn what ailed its exemplary neighbour, and
the marten peered over the edge of the nest
to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the disturbance.
She saw nothing of rabbit or weasels,
for the trees hid them from sight, but she had
an uninterrupted view of the hare, and at once
was all excitement at the prospect of an unexpected
feast. Though she had tasted hare
once and only once, the memory of the delicious
flavour remained, and she had often longed to
taste it again. So eager was she that she could
not take her eyes from off this unlooked-for
prize; even the death-squeal of the rabbit which
presently rent the air did not distract her gaze.
After a while she lay down again, but not
to sleep. She spent the rest of the day
planning the capture of the hare, interrupting
her deliberations only to rise every now and
then to assure herself that the quarry was
still below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far different had been the effect of that
despairing cry on the hare. It left him disquieted
and unnerved, with but one desire, to
get away at the earliest possible moment from
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
the wood and the murderer up above whom
he had surprised in the act of looking down
at him. Short as the day was, he thought
that it would never end; and the moment the
sun dipped below the plain he stole away noiselessly
as a ghost, ascended the opposite hill,
made along the high ridge, passed the earthworks,
crossed the old camp on Bartinney and
came to the chantry, where he stood awhile with
his face towards the sunset. He seemed to be
watching the expiring effort of day, but he was
really considering where he should forage, above
all where he should sit, on the morrow. He
had no wish to sit on the hill; he wanted to get
farther away from the wood than that; farther
from its horrid association with blood. He
thought of the island; he thought of a place
that had once taken his fancy on the cliffs;
he thought of Sennen <a id='dunes'></a>Dunes, and in the end
decided to seek a form there. The moment he
had made up his mind he glanced along his
trail, and, descending the hill, set out across the
lowland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That back look told that he had the pine-marten
in mind; and well he might, for she was
no mean enemy. She had watched the hare
leave the wood, but so great was her dread of
man that she feared to follow till the dusk
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
deepened. As soon as she dared, however, she
came down from the tree and took to the trail,
following it up the long slope and along the
heights past the <a id='lidd'></a>Liddens to the chantry, where,
with her breath coming quickly, she stood
eagerly scrutinising the hillside and the flooded
lowland all agleam in the moonlight. Her coat
was wet from the heavy dew, but she was too
preoccupied to shake it; all her senses were in
her eyes searching in vain for the quarry now
far away in the midst of that water-logged
moor. When she saw no sign, her heart sank;
she was at a loss to know what to do. She was
very loath to abandon the quest, but the dread
of a blank night if she persisted weighed
with her, so she presently forsook the trail on
which she had stood and disappeared into the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the hare, who had reached the
moorland farmstead he had made for, passed
from one small enclosure to another, picking
what little herbage he could find. With the help
of the furze-shoots he managed to get his fill
before leaving to roam for hours over the snipe-haunted
waste. Hither and thither he journeyed,
seemingly without any other object than to
pass the hours away, going farther and farther
from his goal, to which, however, he turned at
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
the first crow of the crofter’s cock, so that the
somewhat stormy dawn found him ensconced in
a shallow pit on the brink of the dunes. He
had chosen wisely; the sand was dry, and the
thick marram-grass screened him from the keen
wind which tore the spindrift from the rollers
that tripped and foundered on the strand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, comfortable though he was, his mind
was ill at ease; he was haunted by the tragedy
of the pinewood. He did all he could to deaden
memory of the scream, but the cries of the gulls
kept it alive till a peregrine shot into view and
drove them to the cliffs: then it faded and left
him at peace. Even now he dreaded falling asleep,
for fear of being visited by nightmare; he fought
against his drowsiness, but in vain; he had
dropped off before the gulls returned. Neither
marten nor weasel harassed his peaceful slumbers,
rendered delectable by a vision of the strand up
and down which he was speeding like the wind,
not alone, but in company with mother and
sister. It was a very vivid dream; he felt the
breeze in his face, the shells under his feet;
his happiness was complete. He was sorry to
awake, but the presence of the beach cheered his
disappointment as he looked forward to a good
gallop on the smooth sand left exposed by the
ebb. At earliest nightfall he left the form
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
and in part realised his dream, tearing up and
down the level foreshore and spurning the sand
as he went. It looked as though he would never
tire, his sinews seemed to be of steel; but at
length he withdrew and betook himself to the
feeding-ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawn after dawn he returned to the dunes.
Dusk after dusk he enjoyed his gallop, till one
night he discovered the <a id='graym2'></a>cat and two kittens
crouching beside the path he always left by.
Then, rather than run the risk of capture, he
decided to forsake the delightful spot and return
to the hill. True to his resolve, he was at
<a id='chap6'></a>Carn Brea on the morrow, and to his joy found
the seat much drier than he expected. Better,
however, had he gone anywhere else, for as
things chanced he was to be the harassed
spectator of a terrible affray between his two
most dreaded enemies, the final scene in the
drama that began to unfold itself soon after he
was ensconced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn was clear despite the grey sky,
with only a belt of mist here and there on the
lowland to interrupt his watch for the night-prowlers
returning to their lair. The scanning
of the moor was his constant practice, because
of the haunting dread he had of being stumbled
on by homing fox or fitchet; in fact, he never
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
settled down with a feeling of real security until
day had fully declared itself and driven all his
persecutors to their retreats. Not a living
thing showed at first; presently however his
gaze was arrested by some animal that issued
wraith-like from a patch of mist, and after crossing
a wide strip of moor entered the croft
bordering the “linhay” field. There he could
see it as it threaded the stunted furze, though
not plainly enough to make quite sure that it
was a fox as he suspected. All doubt was
removed when the creature, after being hidden by
intervening bank and overgrown ditch, crossed
the boundary wall and began stealing up the hill
straight for the form. It was <a id='grey2'></a>Grey Fox himself.
It looked now as if the hare’s forebodings
were at last to be verified, but it was not so,
for the brute entered the clump of tall furze
midway up the slope and remained there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare concluded that the fox had kennelled;
he even judged him to be already asleep,
so weary and exhausted did he look. But Grey
Fox never thought of curling himself up; he
was far too anxious for that; he was eagerly
surveying the plain for sight of the enemy who
had been pursuing him from farm to farm and
moor to moor since midnight. He looked long
without seeing aught, but he dared not compose
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
himself to sleep. Instead he withdrew to the
little grassy space behind the furze, where he
kept walking up and down under the eyes of the
hare, like a wild beast in a cage. “Strange
behaviour this,” thought the hare. “There’s
something very wrong with Grey Fox this morning.
See how his flanks heave! what a mist
his breath makes!” Presently the gaunt creature
ceased pacing and lay down at full length, but
after a few seconds he got up again and went
back to the furze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There he again watches the plain, where a
speck scarcely discernible grows larger and larger,
and tells him that the <a id='lurch2'></a>lurcher has recovered
the trail she had temporarily lost, the trail he
himself had left, and that the lifelong feud is
on the point of settlement, for Grey Fox has
made up his mind to have it out with his enemy.
By this time the hare too has seen the dog,
and whilst following her progress in the furze,
wonders that the fox does not retreat whilst
there is time. So excited does he become that
he fain would warn the fox, but dares not;
though more than once he is on the point of
stamping his feet, he refrains. Meanwhile, the
lurcher shows on the boundary wall, on which
she stands and surveys the face of the hill. Her
breath too comes quick, like jets of steam. She
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
is wondering, as she gets no glimpse of the
game, whether it is worth her while to go any
farther, for twice before during the hare’s
absence from the hill she has hunted Grey
Fox half the night, only to drive him to ground
on the north side of Bartinney, where at this
moment she thinks he is probably curled up in
his inmost den, far beyond her reach. But such
is her keenness that she cannot resist the burning,
alluring trail, and leaping from the wall,
she makes her way up the hill and enters the
furze, where Grey Fox awaits her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without growl or snarl the fight begins.
Except the violent shaking of the bushes, there
is no outward indication of the terrible struggle
that goes on. For a long while the hare,
watching excitedly, sees nothing of the combatants
save the white tip of the fox’s brush,
but anon they come into the open, where
not a spray shuts out the view. They seem
equally matched, because though Grey Fox
leaps, now this way, now that, as if yielding
to the lurcher’s determined onslaught,
he is not giving way: it is but his method
of preventing the enemy from fastening on
his throat. The quickness of his movements is
wonderful, nor does he forget to use his jaws.
See how he snaps! The strange noise is the
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
clashing of his teeth when they fail to get
home. The struggle is too furious to last:
before the lapse of half an hour the life-long
enemies lie exhausted on the ground, face to
face with each other, their laboured breathing
audible to the hare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fox when he recovers has no more
wish to renew the fight than he had to begin
it, but the lurcher’s one thought is to destroy
the hateful wild thing before her, or die in the
attempt. Again they fight; only for a short
while now; limb and wind are unequal to
further effort; their exhaustion is complete.
At last the lurcher recognises that to kill the
fox is a task beyond her powers. After a
time she staggers to her feet and looks into
the eyes of Grey Fox, who has also risen.
The meaning of the looks they exchange no
pen can tell, unless it is that the curled
lips and bare teeth bespeak undying hate.
Then the lurcher withdraws, leaving the fox to
himself. Reynard’s ears are pricked, he is
listening to the retreating footfall, and when
the sound dies away he drags himself into the
bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, screened from the light of the sun
and the eyes of all observers, he sat and licked
his wounds, interrupting the process only to rise
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
and reconnoitre through an opening in one
of the bushes. Though he saw nothing of
the dog, the fears which urged him to withdraw
became at last so insistent that he
actually crept out in the broad sunshine and
made for the earth. At once the hare was
on the alert. His apprehension, however, subsided
on seeing the crippled condition of his
enemy, who was limping on three legs and
had to pick his path. Soon the fox swerved
to avoid a patch of broken ground within
twenty yards of the form, and now he must
pass close to its occupant. Discovery is certain,
is imminent. The hare’s scent betrayed
his near neighbourhood; his conspicuous eye
betrayed his person. Did the fox, ravenous
though he was, attempt the capture of the
prey? Not at all, he knew the futility of
trying in his disabled condition. The situation
was one that called for the exhibition of
his powers of make-believe. His aim was to
convince the hare that he had not seen him, and
to this all his cunning was directed; he checked
the working of his nostrils excited by the scent,
he averted his glance and looking straight before
his long nose, which was badly scarred, held on
as though ignorant of the hare’s presence, with
the demeanour of a creature overwhelmed by
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
misfortune. But the hare, every whit as crafty
as he, had caught the glint of his eye, had
observed the sudden arrest of the nostrils,
had read his mind through and through, and
before Grey Fox was abreast of the chantry
had already made arrangements not to be at
home when he called. An indescribable look
came into the hare’s usually impassive eyes as
he thought of the disappointment that awaited
reynard, on whose mask as he crossed the
ridge played an expression of satisfaction
at the prize that would be his before the moon
was very much older. The prospect of the
delicious feast forced the memory of the fight
into the background; for the rest of the way
he ran on four legs, and it was of the hare, not
of the lurcher, he was thinking when later he
fell asleep curled up in the innermost recess of
his earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the hare, who had resolved to
abandon the hill for a while, sat thinking over
the question of a new seat. His mind once
more ran over all the old forms, but in the end
rejected every one of them for the untried
retreat in the cliffs to which he had been on
the point of going before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he spent on the moorland, where—a
most unusual thing—he did not encounter
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
a single trail or hear a disturbing cry, though
after his gallops he always stopped to listen. He
looked the picture of attention, standing on
knoll or barrow with his great ears raised to
their full height to catch the voices of the
wild. A few seconds only did he bestow on
this duty; he was in too high spirits to give
more. His exuberant energies called for vigorous
exercise, and when he was not spinning along
or hearkening, he skipped and frisked about
like a frolicsome kid. He travelled miles and
miles, “going all ways,” so that midnight had
long passed when he set foot on the strip of
waste overlooking the sea. There he nibbled
the herbage and ate all the blackberries he
could find, shrivelled though they were. Rearing
on his hind legs he stripped every bramble
patch before crossing to the cliffs, where he
dropped from terrace to terrace till he came
to the spot at which he intended to sit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then a steep slope that still more took
his fancy opened to his view. Though eager
to reach it, he paused at the edge of the chasm
that separated him from it; the turmoil of the
water in the gully and the raging of the surge
in the great cave to which the gully led disconcerted
and checked him. After a moment’s
hesitation, however, he leapt the opening, gained
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
the slope, and sat on a cushion of thrift overlapping
the lip of the under-cliff. Within the
ambit of his wanderings he could not have
selected a more secluded spot. Man had never
set foot there; save for the old fisherman who
rested on his oars to gaze at the primroses, sea-pinks,
and foxgloves that in their season decked
this hanging garden, no human eye had seen
its beauty. Even now the solitary furze-bush
amongst the naked rods of the foxgloves was
gay with blossom, for the slope fronted south
and caught the sun. Sitting there the hare
observed every living thing within his ken. He
watched the <a id='gann'></a>gannets that sent the spray flying
as they dived into a school of <a id='pilch'></a>pilchards; he
was interested in the cormorants that stood
on the rock below and dried their outstretched
wings; even the little companies of mullet did
not escape him, when they came scurrying past
the point and coasted round the tiny bay; and
by such sights his attention was drawn, his
curiosity excited, as he enjoyed the warmth
of the sun that brightened the austerity of the
cliff and sparkled on the wintry sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>December found the hare using this retreat.
All went well with him till one day in leaping
the chasm he landed a little short and nearly
fell back into the sea, but by great good
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
fortune his hind feet, striking blindly for support,
found foothold on a ledge. That saved him.
The mishap was the result of carelessness, and
afterwards, being cautious as to the place from
which he took off, he cleared the opening with
several inches to spare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was never free from fear. One
morning he had returned very early whilst the
stars were yet bright; the cluster above the
headland sparkled like a diadem. Towards this
the eyes of the hare were directed, when one
of the constellation was suddenly shut out by
some dark object which was at first unrecognisable;
by and by it turned; it was the pine-marten<a id='mar2'></a>.
The creature went as suddenly as she
came, but soon reappeared on a narrow shelf
of the headland, where she stood looking down
at a <a id='chough'></a>chough some twelve feet below. Rapid in
decision, the marten dropped with the intention
of seizing and disabling the bird before it could
take wing. The chough, however, was too
quick and flew off, so the marten fell on the
rocks, and failing to get the grip for which she
strove frantically, tumbled head over heels into
the boiling sea forty feet below. The hare
thought that he had seen the last of this nimble
enemy. He was soon to be undeceived, for
presently to his surprise her mask, then her whole
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
body showed above the edge of the chasm where
she sat examining the slope. She kept looking
in the direction of the furze-bush as if she
saw something of interest there, then suddenly
turned, leapt the opening without an effort, and
disappeared along the very ledge from which she
had tried to drop on the back of the chough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visit of the marten greatly disquieted
the hare. He believed that if she had discovered
him he could hardly have got away. So the
question, Should he abandon the retreat? confronted
him. He was loath to leave, but in the
end decided to forsake the spot, because he
felt that even if the marten did not return, he
would enjoy no peace through fear that she
would. It was an unfortunate resolve; had he
decided otherwise, he might have avoided the
most harassing trials of his life.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE GREAT WINTER</p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving the form the hare kept loping to
and fro on the strip of waste by the cliffs. No
tempting bit of herbage detained him; he nibbled
neither leaf nor spray; his movements were as
aimless as they could be. He was in a quandary;
he did not know where to turn because
he did not know where he was going to sit,
though it had occupied his thoughts since
the withdrawal of the marten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the many spots that occurred to him not
one offered especial attractions like the hill,
which kept presenting itself to his notice, without
however winning him to it. And this is
not to be wondered at, in view of the fear he
had of being waylaid and gobbled up by Grey
Fox if he ventured there. Nor was his fear
groundless. <a id='grey3'></a>Grey Fox had haunted the hill
in the hope of securing what he esteemed the
titbit of the wild. Day after day in the half
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
light of the morning and in the dusk of the
evening he crouched in one spot after another
beside the path by which he thought the hare
might leave or return, persisting in the quest
until he had completely ringed the form with his
ambuscades and satisfied himself that the hare
was no longer using it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he went to examine the seat: it was
cold and scentless, and he realised what a fool’s
business he had given his best energies to.
Standing there he chided himself for throwing
away so many precious hours, above all for
being outwitted by a hare. Scathing was his
self-reproach, yet brief, for Grey Fox wasted
little time in vain regrets. He wanted to come
to a settlement, and was concerned to know
where the sly hussy of a grass-feeder had betaken
herself. For a moment he stood with his
bluish-green eyes fixed on vacancy, lost in
thought, as if wondering where she could be,
then stole down the slope, trailing his great
brush as he went. He was abandoning the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was on the night that the hare narrowly
escaped falling into the gully, so that after all
puss might have safely returned instead of
racking his poor brain over a new seat. In
the end he found one on the moor, atop of
a grassy mound which had once taken his
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
fancy as he passed. From the slightly raised
station he commanded a wide outlook across
the waste, whose monotony the pool with its
yellow reeds served in some measure to relieve.
The moor, drear and barren though it was,
furnished hospitality to a few migrant birds;
a jack snipe fed within a dozen yards of the
hare, a flock of <a id='plov'></a>golden plover was on the ground
out of his ken beyond the pool. Later, eleven
in all, they flew with musical whistlings over
the reeds and across his front. Nor were
these the only feathered visitors. Soon, as the
weather grew colder, duck, widgeon, and teal
visited the pool to feed, arriving at nightfall
and leaving at dawn for the sea, where
they rested through the day. Their line of
flight was only a little wide of the mound, and
the hare was always back in time to see the
skeins go past. More than once too he
caught sight of the dusky forms of otters stealing
back to the cliffs; they were returning
from a raid on the waterfowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nothing is of long continuance in the
wild. The visits of the duck were abruptly
terminated by the freezing of the pool, and a
phalarope, whom the lone water had attracted,
was driven away at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plover remained, the snipe foraged along
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
a runnel fed by a warm spring, but the heath
was rendered uninhabitable for the hare by
the piercing wind, against which the withered
grasses of the mound afforded no protection.
He endured the discomfort for some days, then
as it became unbearable he forsook the spot
and returned, not without misgivings, to the
hill. But Grey Fox was still present to his
mind; he approached with the utmost caution,
carefully shunned the old form, and sat at a
spot midway between it and the chantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this higher station, however, he found
effectual shelter from the wind, though its whistling
sounded menacingly close, especially when
it rose, as towards night it often did, to a
shriek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its shrillest notes the north-easter was
almost articulate; it seemed to sound a warning
of the bitter weather to come. For the cold
was no mere snap like the previous visitation;
it was, as the old tenant of Brea Farm foresaw
in the red sunsets and dead set of the wind,
the beginning of a season of unusual severity.
The flocks of redwings and fieldfares which
had sought the westernmost angle of the land
found the exposed fields as hard frozen and
inhospitable as those they had fled from. In
the sheltered valleys alone, when the abundant
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
crop of haws along the hedgerows had been
consumed, were they able to pick up a
living and find what was almost as necessary
as food, a roosting-place out of the eye of
the wind. The blackthorn brakes, every branch
of the holly and the furze, any bush screened
by ivy, were all occupied at night by thrushes,
mistle-thrushes, blackbirds, linnets, and finches,
whilst bevies of larks slept on the ground
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remarkable as was that December for the
inrush of common birds, it was scarcely less so
for the rarer visitants: a bittern harboured in
the reed-bed of the pool, a gaggle of bernicle
geese haunted Porthcurnow Cove, five wild
swans sought a refuge in the waters of Whitesand
Bay, whilst quite a number of Dartford
warblers and firecrests found sanctuary in the
snug brakes of Golden Valley. There was
not a sheltered bottom or bay without its
feathered guests. On the other hand, not a bird
was to be found on the hills: Sancreed Beacon,
Caer Bran, Bartinney, were deserted by every
living thing save hibernating adder, slow-worm,
and newt; the old toad and the hare were
the sole tenants of <a id='chap7'></a>Chapel Carn Brea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Protected by his thick winter coat the hare
was able to withstand the nipping frosts that
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
blackened all but the hardiest and most unpalatable
herbage, to which he was for the
most part now driven for support. He fed on
furze and lichens and no longer looked forward
to the joys of pasturing time. Instead, his
thoughts turned to the nights of plenty, to remembered
feasts on tender corn and sweet trefoil, to
banquets on fragrant thyme and juicy sow-thistles,
to titbits like the pinks, above all to the musk,
the tastiest morsel that his beats had furnished.
He never wearied of dwelling on the appetising
list; he would rehearse it again and again, and
wonder whether the good things of the honeysuckle
time would ever come again. He quite
lost himself in these reveries; the hissing of the
wind, even the ring of the horse’s hoofs that
broke in on his musings as the farmer rode away
to market, failed to disturb them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was trying to recall the flavour of dandelions
as he dreamily watched man and horse
cross the lowland which seemed to shrink and
cower beneath the low-hanging sky. Clouds,
grey and depressing, spread from horizon to
horizon save in the south-west, where at
close of day after day the red sun emblazoned
the heaven, and for a brief while bathed
ocean and promontory with its cheery rays.
They were especially pleasing to the hare, coming
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
as they did between the dull day and the
dark night when he wandered far and wide
after pasture. Yet widely as he roamed he never
came across the packs of stoats which the host
of birds had attracted, nor—a thing that
excited his surprise—once encountered Grey
Fox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless he often thought of him, wondering
what had befallen him: whether he had
met his death from the lurcher or been expelled
from the earth by the badgers and betaken himself
elsewhere. Neither supposition was right.
Like the stoat-packs, Grey Fox harboured in
the valleys, attracted by the easily captured
prey and making the most of his opportunity.
It was well for him that he did. In the middle
of December <a id='snow'></a>snow fell, shutting off food from
the birds and causing all but the hardiest to
perish of hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would seem that the wind had delayed the
fall, for no sooner did it die away than the
flakes began to descend, lightly at first, then
close enough to hide all but the nearest objects,
so that when at last they ceased, the land was
covered to a depth of several inches. Spray
and frond did not submit more passively to
the fall than did the hare; in the end he was
as completely hidden as a sheep in a drift.
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
And like the sheep he had not to bear the
weight of his covering, for the heat of his body
thawed the snow round it, with the result that,
when it froze again, a shell of ice was formed,
thin indeed, yet able to sustain its load. For
a while the hare was in complete darkness,
but his breath presently melted the snow in
front of his nostrils, forming a peep-hole through
which he looked out on a world he could no
longer recognise. His very threshold seemed
strange; only the side of the near boulder with
its streaks of yellow and grey lichens presented
a familiar face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy fall had cleared the sky, whence a
vast array of stars looked down on a world as
hushed as the depths they lighted. A wondrous
silence reigned over hill and plain, till it was
broken in the dead of night by a vixen calling
from beyond the farm. The penetrating cry
had scarcely died away when from the distance
came a faint response. On hearing it the
vixen squalled again, and was answered from
Bartinney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the awful squall rang out; this time the
reply rose from beside the rock near the chantry.
The sharp yap, thrice repeated, made the hare
tremble, and no wonder, for it seemed to him to
proceed from the back of his snow-hut. Then
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
he heard the muffled thud of approaching footfall,
and the next instant the form of Grey
Fox flashed by as he bounded down the hill
straight for the curlew-moor, whence the vixen
had called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was as well for the hare that a
vague fear, caused by the new element, had
kept him to the seat, for had Grey Fox and
his mate chanced on him before he was accustomed
to the snow, the countryside might have
known him no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But staying within his snow-hut was not
without its drawbacks; he had to suffer for
his inaction; his fore legs ached; his hind
legs were gripped by cramp; even worse than
that was the itching of his ears, which he was
afraid to scratch for fear of bringing his house
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily these attacks came one at a time,
until the hour before sunset, when they fell
together and nearly drove him mad. The red
sun that had previously been such a comfort
to him, now seemed as if it would never go
down and set him free to stretch his limbs and
scratch his ears. But it sank at last, though
a bit of the rim still showed when he burst out
and made off like the wind. Beyond the chantry
he pulled up; he would at last be rid of the
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
itching in his ears; but the cramp threatened
and sent him going again. So down the hill
he tore, putting his feet into a blind hole and
tumbling head over heels with the impetus of
his rush. He was on his feet in a twinkling, and
aided by the hairy soles of his pads, scurried
over the frozen surface with singular ease
towards the linhay field, where he began scraping
the snow away to get at the herbage beneath.
What little he found he ate ravenously,
but there was not enough to stay his hunger,
which he appeased with the shoots of the furze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light in the farmhouse window was yet
burning when he ceased feeding and began
wandering over the moor. He was not happy.
The vague misgivings which had harassed him
whilst in the form, the disquiet caused by ancestral
monitions, became real fears when he recognised
that he was leaving a trail easy to follow unless
he confused it. Whereupon, coming to the end
of the outward journey, he wove a maze of
tracks amidst the scattered bushes, and the
better to conceal the line by which he returned,
crept along an overgrown ditch where only a
practised poacher could have traced him. He
roamed until day was about to break, and
when the sun arose it found him sitting by the
spring near the <a id='green3'></a>Fairies’ Green.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
He was very tired, but afraid to drowse.
Every moment he expected to see some enemy
coming along his trail, and for hours he kept
watch on the white plain till sleep claimed him,
leaving his sentinel senses on guard. No
moving objects, however, fell on his sight,
nothing save the waste of snow and the vapour
over the spring: no sound smote his ears except
the purl of the rill and the faint tinkle of the ice-crystals
on the sedge, so that—a most unusual
occurrence—he did not awake till the sun was
about to go down and it was time to think of
leaving the form. After an uneventful night’s
wandering he returned to the seat, and would
have continued to use it had not the wind risen
again, rendering the situation so inclement that
he had no choice but to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His intention was disclosed by his carelessness
on quitting the form. Instead of bounding
from it, as was his usual practice, he simply
stepped out, leaving tracks that a child might
have traced home, and leaping across the runnel
he rolled on the green, a thing he would never
have done had he meant to come back. Very
different was his conduct at dawn in the field by
<a id='gard4'></a>Johanna’s Garden. He crossed and criss-crossed
his tracks before springing on to the hedge,
and from that into the garden, where, after two
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
of his longest leaps, he squatted some dozen
yards from the medlar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, carefully as he had concealed his
approach, he could not conceal his person.
Indeed, he looked very conspicuous on the
surface, which, if not quite flat, was only slightly
wavy from the ridge and furrow beneath. Perhaps
he knew that snow threatened, and relied
on it to hide him. However that may be, the
flakes began to fall thickly soon after he had
settled down, and when they ceased he was as
effectually covered as he had been on the hill.
Then the sun came out, turning countryside and
garden into a glittering fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The resplendent enclosure seemed to be crying
out for some creature to enjoy its delights,
when suddenly, without a sound to announce
their approach, two full-grown stoats<a id='stoat'></a> appeared
on the wall by the badgers’ creep and stood
looking down at the snow. They were not
seeking the tracks of the hare, they were not
hunting, they were abroad simply for the snow,
and the next instant they sprang to the ground
and began rolling over one another, uttering a
happy chuckling noise the while. On separating
they wallowed in the snow, as if they could
not get enough of the joy of it. But all at
once they rose to their feet, raised their long
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
necks and listened; an unusual sound had
alarmed them. It was only the noise made by
the snow that fell from the overladen branches,
and the instant they discovered the cause,
they resumed their romps, twisting and turning
like snakes and time after time leaping into
the air. The height they jumped was quite
surprising; almost eerie was their speed as they
galloped over the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare watched them at their games without
serious alarm, he was almost interested in
their movements, when presently they fell to
“hide and seek,” but the moment they gave over
playing and began searching the furrows for
mice he was in dread lest in their tunnellings
they should bump against and discover him.
Hence he kept an anxious look-out, and when
a long interval passed without a sign of them
he suffered agonies of fear. Even when they
did show, it was not much he saw, just their
heads, and that only for a moment or two. As
they approached, however, he could discern the
slight heave of the snow that attended their
progress. Presently up popped the head of the
nearest, within a few yards, and when it was
withdrawn up popped the head of the other in
the adjacent furrow, only to disappear again as
the two made their way towards the gate. The
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
hare, more and more terrified, awaited their
return, and before long saw the snow lift along
the furrow next the one in which he sat. Then
the head of the stoat appeared, but was instantly
drawn back as a dark shadow fell on the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a kite who, in her station high overhead,
had espied the stoats, and carrion-feeder
though she usually was, had come after them.
For the bird, ravenous with hunger, was forced
to get anything she could secure, and from the
medlar-tree on which she alighted watched the
snow eagerly for sign of the prey. The stoats,
aware of her presence, lay as still as death. An
hour, two hours passed, then the bigger stoat
cautiously raised his head to reconnoitre, and on
seeing that the kite was still there, as cautiously
withdrew it, hoping thus to escape her attention.
But in vain: nothing could escape the bird’s
fierce, searching eyes. She instantly glided to
the spot, and with the outstretched talons of her
great yellow feet kept grabbing at the heaving
snow, yet always too far back to secure the
retreating stoat, for he moved with amazing
rapidity and never once stopped nor showed his
head. Of course the <a id='kite2'></a>kite could move as fast as
he, and ought to have caught him; indeed she
would have done, had she not been so stupid
as to keep striking just behind him. A more
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
exciting chase could hardly be witnessed; again
and again the kite seemed to have learned
wisdom and to be about to close her talons
on the stoat, but as often failed, and when at
last she struck directly above the stoat he
had gained the drift by the hedge and was
too deep for her to reach. Thus the pursuit
came to an end, but not the incident, for from
his vantage ground the stoat chattered insults
at the bird as she flew back to the tree to
await the appearance of the other stoat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second stoat, however, had peeped out
during the chase and, seeing the way clear, ran
to the near hedge, where she lay safe amongst the
stones that once formed the walls of the cottage.
Her tracks on the snow told of her withdrawal;
but they had no message for the kite who, after
watching in vain till the day was nearly gone,
at last spread her wide wings and sailed away
in the direction of the <a id='kitec2'></a>Kites’ Carn. Lucky
creature, thought the hare, whose eyes followed
the bird’s flight as far as the narrow peep-hole
allowed, lucky creature to be able to glide
through the air and avoid the drifts. The
reflection came into his mind that night as
he struggled through deep snow near High
Down, whither he was attracted by the hawthorn
bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
On reaching the bleak spot, he went from
tree to tree gnawing the bark on the windward
side, so that while he fed, his back was to the
gale and his face in a measure protected from
the driven snow. He seemed to prefer the rind
on the upper part of the stem, for at each of
the three bushes he stood on his hind feet and
reached as high as he could, despite the swaying
of the bushes under the gusts that shook
them. The creaking noise they made formed a
weird harmony with the moan of the wind,
which was quite in keeping with the spirit of
the haggard upland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the hare, unable to endure the bitter
cold, forsook the down for the lowland and
made for home. Home! Can it be said that
he had ever had a home? The hill had perhaps
the best claim, then there was the Fairies’
Green, and the moor, but all of them too exposed
for him now, hardiest of earth’s children
though he was. Privation, besides, had begun
to tell on him, and in his weakened condition
he turned from the wild to seek the protection
afforded by man; so he was making for
the homestead of whose daily life he had been
so close an observer, striking through the blinding
storm over field and waste as unfalteringly
as though guided by some visible beacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
In the midst of the great croft by <a id='bosc3'></a>Boscawen-Un
stone-circle he became a prey to misgivings
which caused him to stop and consider.
“Is it safe,” he asked himself, “to entrust
myself so near to man?” Instantly from that
mysterious second self of his came the answer,
“Why not? Man has never injured you,
never even sought you, though you have battened
on his crops and taken of his best.” Reassured
by this thought he held on his course across
the moors till abreast of <a id='chap8'></a>Chapel Carn Brea,
where he again paused. Dark though it was,
thickly as fell the snow, he could discern the
form of the great hill that had been to him like
a second mother. If it be possible for beast
to love a spot on earth, the hare loved the hill
where he had been born and suckled, the hill
which had sheltered him, the hill to which, in
his trouble, he had always turned. He had
never passed it by unregarded, he could not
even now. But it looked ghastly and cold, it
repelled him, Chapel Carn Brea repelled him
as a dead thing once loved repels the living;
so he averted his gaze and moved on towards
the homestead. He followed the bridle-path
all the way, but just before reaching the house
he passed under the third bar of the gate of
the rickyard, made his way between the turf
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
and the furze-stack, and jumped on to the wall
in their lee. There he sat between the stems
of two elders, with his face to the farmyard,
wondering what the coming day had in store
for him. His heart was beating faster than
its wont.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span><h1><a id='c09'></a>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>PERIL OF DEATH</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time the hare seemed to be the
only living thing within the homestead: not a
cry broke the silence till the finches and linnets
roosting in the furze-rick, in the eaves and
crannies of the buildings, and even in the
buildings themselves, began to twitter, heralding
with their low, sweet chorus the wintry
dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently too there was a sign of stir within
the house: smoke rose from the chimney, now
and again a spark with it, quenched immediately
by the snowflakes which fell as close as ever,
thickening the covering that lay like a robe of
ermine on the yard, on the roofs of the house,
sheds, barn, and the derelict pigeon-cote springing
from its ridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though the household was astir no
one seemed disposed to venture out, till at last
<a id='andrew'></a>Andrew, the farm-hind, lantern in hand, appeared,
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
his feet sinking deep at every step as he made
for the cattle-stalls under the barn. The flame
lit up his corduroys, his homespun jacket, and
beardless chin; it faintly illuminated the mud
wall on which his shadow fell; it dispelled the
pitchy darkness of the byre, where with loud
lowings ox and bullock greeted his entry.
He was soon busy chopping turnips, whose
fragrance spread around till it reached the hare
and set him longing; then the munching of
the cattle almost drove him beyond endurance;
but he remembered that he was an outlaw, so he
turned a deaf ear to the tantalising sound,
though he could not help envying the beasts
which he had hitherto pitied. By this the
<a id='brea'></a>farmyard was wide awake; the inmates of
every shed and pen clamoured to be fed;
the bull bellowed, the horse whinnied, the pigs
squealed, the geese cackled, the rooster crowed
at the top of his voice, whilst the linnets,
finches, siskins, a yellow-hammer and a snow-bunting
looked mutely on, hoping not to be
forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the hours of early morning passed,
succeeded by a sunless forenoon and the dinner
hour, during which the hare contemplated an
act of unusual daring, nothing less than joining
the three yearlings who were eating hay from
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
a rack in the midst of the yard. After all, it
did not seem a great thing to do. He had
but to slip from the wall, steal a dozen yards
or so over the snow, then the fodder would be
his for the taking. Yet he could not do it;
his wild nature restrained him. Once indeed
he half rose, only, however, to settle down again
and watch the yearlings empty the rack, which
the man removed on returning from his dinner.
As he carried it he chanced to look towards
the hare, who, ever suspicious, feared that he
was discovered. It was quite a critical moment
to the wildling; had the man’s eyes met his,
had the man only stopped whilst gazing in his
direction, he would have made off: luckily,
neither event befell, so that the hare, who had
gathered himself ready to spring, relaxed his
muscles and remained. The incident, however,
left him somewhat disquieted, till a wren
foraging in the elder diverted his thoughts;
then he became composed and followed the movements
of the man with the same unconcern as
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, fearful as he was of man’s gaze, he was
able to disregard sounds that would have made
fox, marten, and stoat cower and slink to cover;
he was quite unmoved by the shrill voice of the
farmer’s wife when she called after her husband,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
“Mind, John, whatever you do, don’t forget
the saffron<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> and a penn’orth of Christmas<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a>”; he
never even started when the man wrenched the
faggots from the furze-rick, though he sang the
Flora<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> tune to words of his own composition,
as he pulled at the stems. Three loads of faggots
the man bore to the house, the low sun which
caught the ridge of the barn and cote bathing
his face as he went past the farmyard gate. In
the quiet that reigned when at last the kitchen
door closed for the night behind him the hare
dropped to the yard, where he picked up every
blade of hay he could find before leaving for
his round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rarely had he been at a greater loss to
know where to go; it was of no use seeking
the moor, nothing but the unpalatable bark of
withy and alder awaited him there, the fields
with their scant herbage were out of his reach,
High Down was inaccessible since the last snowfall;
so without a goal to make for, he loped
along the bridle-track, where at least the going
was easy, and food, such as it was, to be had
in the furze that bordered it. He was in
hard case, yet not so hard as that of the predatory
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
creatures who nightly ravaged the country
and often returned supperless to their lairs. The
hare knew of their forays from the trails. He
had crossed two on his way back from the
Down; this very night he leapt the burning line
of a <a id='stoat2'></a>stoat-pack just before turning aside whilst
the farmer rode past. Close to <a id='crow2'></a>Crowz-an-Wra
he stopped to browse on the bushes, standing
on his hind legs and reaching as high as he
could to get at the tender shoots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eager, however, as he was to satisfy his
hunger, he was alive to everything around, and
kept pricking his ears at the noise of the
merriment from the cottages with windows
all aglow from turnip lantern, rushlight, and the
blaze of furze fire. For Crowz-an-Wra was
keeping Christmas Eve with its customary
cheer, little dreaming of the lonely stranger at
their doors. At his slowest pace the hare passed
through the village; he was no more alarmed
by the illumination of the cottages than by the
splendour of the heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just beyond the milestone he frisked and
frolicked, and in the same high spirits galloped
along the track as far as the granite cross,
where, in his leverethood, he had scampered up
and down the then dusty way under the eyes of
his mother. At the cross he stood and listened
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
as he had listened then, but there was not a
sound; even the little stream had been frozen
into silence. So he fell to rolling on the
crisp surface, which crackled under him; then
jumping to his feet, he scratched a pit in the
snow simply to get rid of the energy which the
nip in the air had excited. About midnight he
galloped off through the deep snow at a pace
that was surprisingly rapid, considering the
weight of the snow that clung to his fur. Soon
he was out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four hours later he repassed the cross on
his way home. The heavens were as resplendent
as ever; Orion showed no sign of fading,
the Milky Way was still a path of splendour,
but the hamlet lay in gloom, and save for the
rocking of a cradle, was as silent as the hills.
In the homestead there was not a sound, and
as if afraid to disturb the quiet, the hare stole
noiselessly as a ghost to the form, where he
sat watching for the dawn without a thought of
sinister intrusion on the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he had not been there long when the
cruel head of a <a id='pole4'></a>polecat showed at the far corner
by the pigsty, whence it surveyed the enclosure.
She had not come for prey, she had come for
shelter, and her keen eyes were peering here,
there, and everywhere to see that the coast
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
was clear before she tried to reach the retreat
that had taken her fancy. Presently she galloped
past the door of the cattle-house and made her
way to the top of the barn steps. There she
stood looking for a way in, and descrying a
hole in the shutter, she scrambled up and aslant
the mud wall till she gained it and squeezed
through. She had not long disappeared, however,
when to the amazement of the hare, her
head was suddenly thrust through the snow covering
the thatch, and the next instant she was
hurrying over the white surface to enter the
pigeon-cote. Now the cote was the home of
an <a id='owl3'></a>owl. Scarcely had the polecat curled up
in it when the bird alighted on the sill, discovered
the intruder, and made such a to-do
that the polecat at once came out lest man’s
notice should be attracted, her presence revealed,
and—the dread of her life—hue and cry raised.
In the circumstances she was for peace at any
price. Dashing past the owl she made down
the roof to the hole in the thatch, where she
struggled for some time to get through. At last
as the result of a desperate effort she forced a
passage to the barn, and so reached the yard by
the way she came. From the foot of the steps
she headed for the narrow passage by which
she had entered, but, instead of following it, she
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
skirted the pigsty, the poultry-houses and the
open shed, with the intention of crossing the
wall to the turf-rick which she had noticed from
the roof. She reached the wall and was about
to climb it when the latch of the kitchen door
lifted. At the sound she abandoned her purpose,
and that very unwisely, because she was
in quite as much danger of being seen as if she
had crossed the wall. For where was she to
hide? There was the open shed, it is true, but
she could hardly hope to gain it before the man
reached the yard. “Crunch, crunch, crunch,”
sounded the snow under his feet; he was already
close to the gate, discovery was imminent. In
desperation, the bewildered creature dived into
a hole in the snow made by a hoof of one of
the yearlings. Even then her tail was exposed
for some seconds before she succeeded in worming
a way out of sight, but it did not catch
the eye of the man, and for the time at least
she was safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare, who had observed every movement
of the polecat, kept a close watch on the spot, for
he greatly feared that the creature would cross
the wall at the first opportunity and perhaps
discover him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the hind busied himself about his
ordinary duties until near noon, when he began
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
to remove the snow from the front door, a sure
sign that guests were expected. As he shovelled,
he sang:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“I saw dree ships come sailing in,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Sailing in, come sailing in,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;I saw dree ships come sailing in,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;On Christmas Day in the morning”—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>shovelling and singing till the steps and the path
all the way to the gate were clear. No sooner
had he finished than the farmer’s three sons
arrived, with their wives and families, the women
riding pillion behind their husbands, and the
children in panniers borne by donkeys. There
was quite a string of donkeys; the headgear
of each and of the little foal which closed the
procession, was decked with holly; the merry
voices of the laughing, chattering children
rang out most musically. Last of all came
the <a id='fid'></a>fiddler, a long, lean man, shivering in his
thin garments as he ran, his nose blue with
cold, his violin in a green baize bag under his
arm. He threw a snowball at <a id='andrew2'></a>Andrew, then
skipped up the steps like a lamplighter, and as
the door closed on the heels of his cloth boots,
it shut in the welcome with which the children
greeted his arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the work that Andrew got through
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
between the coming of the fiddler and two of
the clock, in order not to be “worrited” whilst
at meat, was a record on Brea Farm. In
the multitude of his duties, however, one thing
escaped him—he forgot to shut up the <a id='roost2'></a>rooster.
The oversight, as things turned out, meant a
sore trial for the cock, tragic consequences for
the hare. Nor were they long in coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a few minutes past three the long snout,
yellow eyes, and red tongue of <a id='grey4'></a>Grey Fox
appeared round the very corner where the polecat
had showed. Whilst lying in the brake,
he had heard the cock crow, and with his mate
had come after it. They had come as fast as
they could lay pad to ground; they were starving.
For three days they had found nothing
to eat over the miles and miles of country they
had searched, and now at last within four leaps,
there stood this fat rooster scratching away
the snow. Was ever so tempting a morsel,
ever so easy a victim, exposed to the eyes of
ravenous wildlings? Yet the unusual silence
excited Grey Fox’s suspicions of a trap. Might
not the bird be a bait, a decoy to lure him into
the gin where he had already left one of his
claws? If not, what was cock-a-doodle doing
there alone? After all it was too great a risk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But by this the little vixen—she looked but
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
half the size of her mate—who at first kept at
his brush, had come more and more forward till
her mask was side by side with his. Did she
by whisper or sign of eye or lip banish his
scruples, goad him into action? We do not
know. But the next instant he launched himself
towards chanticleer, who saw him coming
and raised cries so penetrating that they caused
the hind and the fiddler to drop knife and
fork and rush to the yard. Grey Fox had just
seized the cock when the fiddler burst out, and
making the most of his long legs, succeeded in
heading him from the passage that led to the
moor. The fox refused to drop his prey, though
the huge wings kept flapping in his face and
hindering him in the race with the fiddler, who
pursued him over the dung-heap and around the
yard, to the amusement of the rest of the party
crowding the gateway. As he ran, the fiddler
trod on the polecat, whose sudden appearance so
startled the fox that he dropped the cock, crossed
the wall to the rickyard, and rejoined his mate,
who had hurried away to the moor at the first
shout of the fiddler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merry as the party was before, it was twice
as merry now, yet there was not a child, nay,
nor a grown-up around that festive board, who
would not have been sorry to know that in
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
the act of crossing the wall Grey Fox had
espied the hare and was already plotting his
destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For in the earth amidst the furze, Grey Fox,
who had an old score to settle, and the <a id='vix2'></a>vixen,
who had searched for him when a helpless leveret,
sat mask to mask, with wrinkled brow, scheming
how they should take him. It was a matter
of life or death to them, at least so they themselves
regarded it; and the moment their plans
were laid they were all eagerness to put them
into execution. Their eyes glowed with excitement;
twice they rose and went to the mouth
of the earth to observe the light; the third
time they stole away to the rickyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the wall, Grey Fox peeped over,
and turning his head slowly to avoid attracting
notice, exchanged looks with the vixen. “It’s
all right, she is in the seat,” that is what his
glance conveyed. As the light faded he got
on the wall, and watched as he crouched. Later
the vixen took his place whilst he stole round
to the other end of the wall. The hare was now
between them, knowing all, and taking counsel
with himself. From time to time the sound of
the fiddle or the laughter of the children broke
the tense silence, but without disquieting the
foxes, who lay with their heads towards the
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
yard ready to spring the moment the hare made
off. Then the hind came and saw to the cattle,
and as he presently returned to the house, hare
and foxes gathered themselves for the work before
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a mighty bound the hare reached the
yard and made for the gate, through which he
passed to the front of the house with the foxes
in close pursuit. The light from the window
fell on the fleeting forms of all three as they
rounded the corner by the beehives on their
way back to the bridle-track, which the hare
followed to the point where it bends. There,
instead of swinging round in the direction of
the hamlet, he set his face straight for <a id='chap9'></a>Chapel
Carn Brea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as at all times, he looked to the hill
to escape his pursuers, but it was no longer the
familiar place it had been, for the pits filled by
the snow were level with the runways. Consequently
the surface was treacherous, and therein
lay the hope of the foxes, a hope immediately
realised. Twice during the ascent the hare fell
into blind holes, from which he managed to
extricate himself only just in time to avoid
being seized by Grey Fox. Though he escaped
capture he lost the lead he had gained; abreast
of the chantry he was so dangerously close to his
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
pursuers that a false step would have meant
death, and he knew it; while the foxes, who knew
it too, were already anticipating a feast. For
thirty yards farther the ground beneath the
snow was so broken, so full of pitfalls, that the
chances of traversing it without stumbling were
small, but the hare got over it without mishap
and reached the ridge, along which he held
bravely, for the going there was good. His heart
sank, however, at sight of the snow in the hollow,
where only a rush or two showed above the
smooth surface. But those few rushes served
as a guide, a welcome guide, for they indicated
the position of the <a id='lidd2'></a>Liddens, towards which he at
once directed his steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this he was wise, because the ice afforded
reliable foothold to his hairy pads and enabled
him to plough his way through the snow at quite
a good pace, much faster indeed than the foxes,
though they kept along the furrow in his wake.
The lead thus gained he kept on increasing
as he ascended Bartinney, to the discomfiture
of his pursuers, who would have abandoned the
chase had not the big drift in the next hollow,
which they believed impassable, encouraged them
to keep going. On reaching it the hare’s
courage failed him, and no wonder, for stretching
from foothill to foothill, and completely filling
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
the dip between, lay like a great white lake,
a drift which threatened to overwhelm him.
Face to face with this new danger he forgot the
foxes for a moment, but the instant he looked
back and caught sight of them bounding down
the hill, he flung aside his hesitation, plunged
into the <a id='drift'></a>drift, and put forth all the strength of
his limbs in an effort to reach the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearer and nearer the foxes came to the drift;
they leapt into it without flinching, and began
to battle with the feathery mass, striving to overhaul
the hare now some dozen yards ahead.
It was a weird scene, that drift amidst the
hills, marked now by the glowing eyes of three
protruding heads, now by the tips of the ears,
now only by a slight flurry of the surface,
which showed where pursuers and pursued
struggled beneath, till, where the snow lay
deepest, there was no slightest sign of movement,
and it seemed as if all three had found a
grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last towards the farther side the points of
two ears showed, then two eyes; they were the
ears and eyes of the hare, who had tunnelled
his way thus far, and was standing on his hind
legs looking round to see where he was. Before
you could count three the head was withdrawn
and the hare again lost to sight, but presently
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
out he came from the drift with a long leap, the
snow on his back shooting forward between his
ears as his fore feet struck the ground. He
bounded up the slope, and had gone perhaps a
score yards when the foxes emerged, pressing
after him at their best pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle with the drift had told more on
the hare than on them. Between the drift and
<a id='caer3'></a>Caer Bran, where he passed close to the spot on
which months before he had sat dreaming of
the life before him, he actually lost ground, yet,
though seemingly doomed, on, on he sped; nay,
more, he even began to gather his strength for
a supreme effort to shake off his pursuers. The
wood on the Beacon was the place he chose for it.
The moment he felt the pine-needles under his
pads he breasted the hill with the speed of the
wind, and gained its granite crown several
seconds ahead.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This spurt amazed the foxes, for they imagined
the hare to be failing, and they would have been
still more amazed had they known how he was
using his advantage. He did not keep on as
the foxes themselves would have done, for
that he thought would only prolong the chase,
whereas his intention was to put an end to it.
So just over the ridge he leapt from rock to
rock and back again, then to the great slab that
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
looks like a vast table amidst the furze, and
finally into the furze itself, into which he flung
himself just in the nick of time, the bushes closing
over him as Grey Fox appeared on the apex
of the Beacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With swift glances Reynard swept the hillside,
but not a spray stirred to mark the line along
which their escaping prey was stealing towards
the foot of the hill; forthwith he and his mate,
who had now come up, stooped again to the scent
with the object of following the trail. But the
hare had succeeded in foiling his line; they
immediately discovered the hopelessness of the
task, and both returned to the high rock conscious
that their only chance lay in sighting the hare as
he left the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their movements had been as quick as
lightning, so quick that not more than ten
seconds had passed since Grey Fox gained the
<a id='creed2'></a>Beacon. How his flanks heaved, how quick the
breath came from him, yet despite distress of
lung and agony of lacerated pads that stained
the snow with blood, his one thought was for
the game; he did not waste a glance on the
lanterns<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> illuminating the church tower, he
was deaf to the carol-singers, all his senses were
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
in the eyes that watched every opening between
the bushes, every avenue of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, they—for the vixen was at his side—sighted
the hare as it crossed the bridge far
below. Instantly they were off. Twice Grey Fox
tumbled head over heels in his mad haste, but
the shaking made no difference to him: there
was no slackening in the speed with which he
led along the trail which presently recrossed the
stream to a plantation. Here, in their excitement,
first he then the vixen gave tongue on
the scent. Their sharp yaps fell like a death-knell
on the ears of the hare, who, believing
the pursuit was at an end, was loping leisurely
along the bank of the stream. For a moment
his heart sank within him, but only for a
moment; the next he pulled himself together
and redoubled his pace, the thought of being
seized and gobbled up by Grey Fox acting
like a spur on his flagging energies. At a bound
he again recrossed the stream, sped across the
slope of the opposite hill in full view of the foxes
and headed for a gap at the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuers’ plan was formed at once: they
would waylay him at the gap and seize him as
he passed. A hedge with a ditch on its further
side ran up the hill. At their utmost speed the
two foxes galloped along the ditch, gained the crest
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
and reached the gap whilst the unsuspecting prey
was yet a dozen yards from it. The fate of the
hare was apparently sealed. But Grey Fox was
not content to trust his ears to apprise him of
the hare’s approach; in his eagerness he could
not resist peeping round the corner. This
betrayed him: the hare saw his long snout,
turned and made down the hill, the breathless
foxes following as fast as they could. In the
descent the hare gained quite a good lead, but
it seemed all to no purpose, for his line of
flight was leading him directly towards a <a id='quarry'></a>quarry
which cut off all escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet on he galloped straight to the brink,
and reaching it, leapt headlong into the great
drift that rose half-way up its sheer wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foxes checked themselves on the very
verge and stood gazing at the snow marked
by the cleanly-cut hole made by the hare
as he fell. “Done after all,” was the meaning
of the expression on Grey Fox’s mask. But
he was not to be thus deprived of his prey if
search could avail, and to this end he and the
vixen made their way down to the base of the
quarry and were lost to sight in the drift as
they worked towards the spot where they expected
to find the hare lying dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far from being dead, however, he was not
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
even disabled; indeed he was none the worse
for his dive, the snow having completely broken
his fall. On feeling the ground beneath his
pads he moved forward, and had advanced some
twelve yards when he found himself confronted
by the huge heap of loose rock which the
quarrymen had piled there. It barred his way,
threatening to prevent his escape, until presently
he found a small opening, and through it
squeezed to a narrow tunnel-like passage which
led to a chamber littered with the remains of
rabbits, mice, eels, and frogs. It was a <a id='pole2'></a>polecat’s
den—the den, indeed, of the polecat that had
chased him, the den where she and her kittens
had slept after the pursuit. He crossed the
foul lair and tried to pass through the narrow
space between two rocks on the farther side.
This looked like courting destruction, for he
ran the risk of being jammed and unable to
extricate himself; but he could hear the foxes
behind him; he must go that way or perish.
With a struggle he forced his head and shoulders
through; then he was fixed, he could not clear
his hindquarters, tug and strain as he might.
As he stopped to recover his breath, he caught
the patter of his pursuers’ pads: they were
approaching the den: in a few seconds Grey
Fox’s jaws would close on him and the rocks
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
ring with his death squeal. Frantic with fear,
maddened by dread of his fate, he made
a frenzied effort and just managed to pull his
long hind legs through before Grey Fox could
seize them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet to that very opening which had all but
proved his destruction, he was now to owe his
life. For Grey Fox, desperately anxious to reach
him, forced his great head through the hole with
the hope of seizing him, and got it so firmly
wedged that some minutes elapsed before he
succeeded in withdrawing it. By that time the
hare was once more well on his way up the hill.
He had passed over the brow before the foxes discovered
the line of his retreat. But it was soon
evident, from their half-hearted manner, that they
were on the point of abandoning the pursuit, which
they did a bow-shot beyond the lighted cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a change had come over them! They
hardly looked the same creatures as when, alive
in every fibre, they had stood on the Beacon,
the embodiment of eagerness and energy. Now
their heads drooped, their brushes that had waved
like feathers, dragged and seemed to weigh them
down. They looked dispirited, as indeed they
were, and humbled too: the grass-feeder had
proved more than a match for both of them,
though, as they had seen, he was hampered by
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
large balls of snow that clung to his fur. They
went back the way they had come, the vixen
leading, Grey Fox hopping on three legs. Twice
he stopped to scratch his aching jaws, and
at the bend by the quarry he disappeared
from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hunt was over, but even when satisfied of
that the hare still held on. He was harassed
now by a fresh fear, the fear of being tracked.
This possessed him so strongly, that weary as
he was, he wandered in and out the patches
of scattered furze, confusing his trail so as to
baffle any enemy who should try to trace
him, and not until the long night was giving
way to dawn did he settle in his form, which
he sought in the old spot on the bank of the
mill-pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day, whilst the Squire was abroad after
woodcock, he came on the triple trail above the
quarry, and recognising the track of the hare,
was at once filled with desire to see the end
of the story told on the snow. His excitement,
as he stood on the lip of the quarry,
looking at the shaft-like hole, astonished his
henchman: the feeling he displayed when he
discovered the track of the hare by the cottage
door was altogether beyond the man’s comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
“Ah, that shows how sorely the poor thing
was pressed. Had the door been open, she
would have gone in and taken her chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At every stride he expected to come on the
end of the tragic chase, and kept looking ahead
for the remains that would mark the last
scene. All the greater, then, was his delight
to find that the foxes had withdrawn from
the chase, and greater too his determination to
try and get a view of the animal whose survival
in that vermin-haunted district seemed
little short of miraculous. For three hours he
followed the trail, pondering as he went
over the animal’s hairbreadth escapes as his
imagination called them up and, in his anxiety
to come on the hare before dusk, almost losing
his temper at the delays the creature’s ruses
caused him. “Give it up, Squire,” said his man
at last; “you’ll never come up with her, take
and give it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not whilst there’s light to see by,” was
the laconic reply. It was nearly four o’clock
when they came to the mill-pool. Even then
they searched and searched in vain, for as the
hare had landed from his last spring the snow
fell from the tuft and concealed him. “She’s
here, I know she’s here,” said the Squire in
despair. The words were scarcely out of his
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
mouth when the hare bounded from his feet
and crossed the pond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot, shoot,” shouted the man; “darn ’ee,
shoot.” Instead of raising his gun, the Squire
raised his hand and kept it at the salute till the
creature passed from sight. It was his way of
paying homage to an animal hero.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE FIENDS OF THE WILD</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unrelenting as the frost seemed on Christmas
Day, it yielded the next night but one to a
warm westerly wind, the thaw setting in before
dawn. When Andrew crossed to the bullock-house,
water was dripping from the barn, by
noon bush and boulder were beginning to
show on the hill, at nightfall runnel and stream
were chattering along their courses. The sound
of running water cheered the birds at roost
on branch and spray; it cheered the hare
too, who kept snuffing the warm breeze that
relaxed the icy fetters on the stream and melted
the snow clogging his fur. Within forty-eight
hours the balls of snow had completely disappeared,
leaving him as light as a feather for
his gallop over the moorland, where his path
was marked by the spray which he spurned
from the shallow pools. The splashes seemed
to be caused by some ricochetting missile, so
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
fleet were his movements: surely in all his
life he never sped more swiftly than then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he revelled in the exercise of his
unencumbered limbs, he had a keen eye to his
safety: the most wily of hunted creatures could
not have been more alert and vigilant than he.
Once from the solitary rock, again and again
from knoll and barrow he surveyed the waste
to learn whether any enemies were in sight,
for he was well aware of their famished condition,
and understood that they would employ
the greatest stealth in attempting his capture.
He kept a sharp look-out for Grey Fox, carefully
examining every object that excited his
least suspicion, and in his great dread of a stoat
pack he repeatedly scrutinised the surface for
the sinuous living line that would apprise him
of its approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he thought he detected the eerie
serpentine movement characteristic of the stoat;
but he was mistaken, the three packs which
infested his beats were miles away at the time.
Though all were terrible scourges to the animals
that supplied them with blood, the most formidable,
on account of the sagacity and endurance
of its leader, was the pack, numbering
fourteen in all, whose main stronghold was
the Lamorna cliffs. Even this pack was in
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
peril of famine because of the wariness and
scarcity of prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their straits they invaded the homesteads,
and on the fourth day of the thaw, when the
ice in the pools was the last vestige of the
frost, the starving brutes came pouring over
the wall of Brea farmyard and made straight
for the poultry-houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some sought the door of the fowls’ house,
causing the rooster to shift uneasily on his perch;
the rest circled the ducks’ house without finding
a way in, for Andrew had stopped the holes in
the floor to which they penetrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus baulked they entered the cattle-sheds
and barn, where in the dead silence they could
be heard rustling among the straw. Presently a
rat appeared on the roof and climbed to the old
weather-cock on the roof of the pigeon-cote.
Two stoats followed, but failed to trace him to
the forlorn refuge whence he was watching them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour passed thus in profitless search
before the leader, standing in the middle of the
yard, uttered a shrill cry. This rallied the
band to her, and the yard at once seemed
alive with the restless creatures darting hither
and thither in their impatience to be gone.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>They took little notice of the owl that glided
to and fro, screaming as it flew; yet they were
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
so ravenous that they would have killed and
eaten him, if they could have caught him, bird
of prey though he was. The farmer’s wife
lay awake wondering what ailed the screech-owl:
the hare in the field bordering the bridle-track
also wondered, but like the woman, without
surmising the cause. The noise ceased when
presently the pack left the yard and made
past the sycamore towards the lane, seemingly
on the way to the “curlew” moor. When
abreast of the broken grindstone, however, the
leader, who was at her wits’ end to know where
to go, suddenly turned and retraced her steps
along the bridle-track. Abrupt as was her turning
movement each stoat kept its place as
though it were part of a snake, which in truth
the long file closely resembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the stone steps into the field where
the hare was at pasture, the leader appeared
to be in two minds as to whether she should
mount them or go straight on. A hedgehog
brought her to a decision. He had been
drawn from his winter quarters by the open
weather, showed just then on the path and
instantly attracted her. He was very sleepy,
but he saw the stoats coming, immediately curled
into a ball, and so awaited their onset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What savagery the famished creatures exhibited!
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
What determined though futile efforts
they made to penetrate the hedgehog’s defence!
Blood was drawn, it is true, their heads were
smeared with it, but it was their own blood
which they licked before again falling tooth and
nail on the prickly ball. Their second assault
proving as unsuccessful as the first, they formed
a ring around the urchin, chattering to unnerve
it and so cause it to unfold. All their
efforts were vain, the hedgehog was impregnable
to moral as to physical attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though the blood-curdling chorus was
wasted on the hedgehog, it so affrighted the
hare that he broke into a panic-stricken flight,
nor did he stop till he had reached the chantry.
There he stood listening for the cry he dreaded.
His apprehensions however were unwarranted,
the stoats were ignorant of his neighbourhood,
and on abandoning the hedgehog retreated
in the direction of the southern cliffs, slowly at
first but more quickly as the night grew old,
for fear of being surprised by dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint glow suffused the low east when
they reached Carn Boscawen, proceeded singly
along ledge after ledge to its sea-washed face,
clambered between the breaking waves up and
up the wet rock and finally crept into crevices
beyond reach of the spray.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
For a while not a hair of them was to be
seen, but the moment the sun rose they appeared
at the mouths of the stronghold and lay with
their long, gaunt bodies stretched to their full
length to catch what little warmth the lurid orb
vouchsafed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the light of day these night marauders
looked the cruel, bloodthirsty bandits they were,
the three whom the spell of Arctic cold had
ermined presenting an even more fiendish aspect
than the others. When too the sun
passed behind the angry clouds so that carn
and sea, shorn of the rays that gilded them,
lay in deep shadow, the outlawed crew seemed
to be in harmony with their savage surroundings
and no unfit neighbours of the kite perched
on the crag above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By and by, suddenly as they had appeared,
they withdrew, curled up on the rocky floor and
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a contrast the hare in his seat on the
hill furnished to the carnivorous bandits of
the carn! He looked as fearful as they
looked bold, his long, quivering ears proclaimed
his timidity no less plainly than the prominent
eyes that overlooked the moor all the grey afternoon
till they turned towards a storm far out at
sea where lightning played in a black cloud,
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
below which presently the blood-red sun went
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus was ushered in a night of tragedy
with hare and stoats for actors, moor and cliff
for setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dusk the hare left his couch and descended
the hill to his pasture on Brea Farm. There he
wandered from enclosure to enclosure picking up
what little herbage he could find. It took him
hours to get his fill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the stoats who had quitted their
fastness were heading for the moor, tempted by
the presence of some wading birds which they
had disturbed the previous night on their return
journey. On the way they turned aside here
and there in the hope of securing other prey,
so that it was within an hour of midnight
when they reached the purlieus of the waste,
that looked pitch-black beneath the stormy
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the spot where they struck the heath
they were two miles from the linhay field which
the hare presently left for his usual gallop. So
wide however was its surface that nine times out
of ten the pack might have hunted and the
hare enjoyed his spin without either being
aware of the other’s presence; twice it had so
happened during the month now within an
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
hour of its close; but the hare’s good fortune
had temporarily forsaken him and his time
come to stand before the pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Black though the night was, had the hare
been as alert as usual, he could hardly have
failed to discern at least the ghostly forms
of the white members of the band in time
to secure a long start and perhaps get clean
away. Immunity from molestation in the moor
explains the poor look-out he kept. His lack
of vigilance was to cost him dear, inasmuch
as he succeeded in arresting his steps only just
in time to avoid running into the pack as it
showed above the slight rise that for a few
seconds had effectually concealed it from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of them he turned and fled, and
though more frightened than ever before, did
the best thing possible; he made straight for the
pool, for he hoped by placing the wide water
between him and his pursuers to disconcert
them and put an end to the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stoats followed, forging ahead at their
utmost pace, except when they checked their
steps and stood still to look about them as is
their wont; why, it is impossible to say, but
certainly not to give “law” to the quarry. So
several seconds ahead of them, the hare reached
the pool midway between the islet and the
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
reed-bed, plunged in, floundered through the
shallows, and on getting beyond his depth,
struck out for the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ice still covered most of the surface, but following
an open channel he got more than half-way
across before he found himself confronted by
a sheet which, thin and rotten though it was,
arrested his progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to clamber on to it but the brittle
edge broke under his pads. His position was
most critical. To make matters worse, the cry
of his pursuers now sounded very distinct; they
were evidently close to the pool. What if they
took to the water and met him as he swam?
For he must go back or drown. In the
dilemma he turned and struck out for the
shore he had left. He seemed to be swimming
into the jaws of death. Soon however fortune
befriended him. For as he swam he saw at
one side a narrow strait just wide enough to
admit him, and into it he turned as the pack
took to the water, swimming swiftly and with
heads held high. They must have viewed the
hare had not the moon been completely obscured
by a black cloud, which completely shut
off the pallid beams that for a brief space had
lit the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they passed the narrow opening and
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
approached the barrier. No barrier did it prove
to them. They landed with the greatest ease,
galloped over the ice, gained the shore and began
casting for the quarry. Meanwhile the hare had
gained the reed-bed whence, owing to the
conspicuousness of the ermined stoats, he was
able to follow the movements of the pack, till
presently the ghostly forms were swallowed up
in the darkness as they made for the further
end of the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare seizing the opportunity made off,
his face set for the “curlew” moor. No longer
however does he move with full freedom of limb;
the paralysing influence of the stoats is upon
him. How he labours as if held back by some
restraining hand, how slow his progress! He feels
doomed, for escape is impossible and refuge there
is none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he stops, as suddenly resumes his
way, but in a direction at right angles to his
former course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the black waste he has seen the
glimmer of light that tells of the presence of
man. He is making towards it as to a beacon
of hope. By and by he reaches the church,
from whose coloured windows the glow proceeds,
and from his station amongst the tombs
listens to the singing. Whilst he listens there
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
comes from the moor the shrill cry of his
pursuers. At the sound he resumes his flight,
following the rude road through the village
towards Sennen Green, where he halts as if
loath to quit the abode of man for the wild
beyond. Death is approaching, but it must
overtake him; he cannot await his fate. Whilst
the bells ring the old year out, the new year
in, he lopes on and on past Vellandreath,
past Genvor to the lonely Tregiffian cliffs. There
from a rise he looks back and sees the extended
file of his enemies as they gallop down
the opposite slope. The ground in front is
studded with rocks. Threading his way among
these he finds himself within a score yards of
some men lying on the turf. As they lie they
form an irregular ring. Into this he passes
without an instant’s hesitation and squats in their
midst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stoats on the other hand fell to silence,
stopping motionless by the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were smugglers<a id='smug'></a> and all asleep save
the sentry, who lay near the edge of the cliff
watching so eagerly for the expected boat that
he had not heard the stoats’ cry, though it
sounded distinct above the roar of the sea.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the man rose to his feet and paced
up and down, his oilskins creaking as he moved.
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
Only for a moment did he take his eyes
from the dark waters below whilst he ignited
the tinder and lit his pipe. Now and again
a spark was blown in the direction of the
stoats, but they took no more notice of that
than of the cry uttered by one of the sleeping
smugglers. Nothing would drive the bold,
ravenous pack away, at least nothing but dawn;
and that was hours and hours distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a red light came and went near
the foot of the cliffs; it was a signal from the
boat and was answered by the watch with a
hoot like that of a screech-owl. Immediately
all was stir, the men jumping to their feet
and making for the adit that communicated
with the cave into which the boat with its
load of kegs had already been taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare, far from being frightened by the
sudden commotion, dogged the steps of the
men and sat in a recess in the wall of the
tunnel; the stoats who had followed dared not
penetrate there; so they stood and watched him
from the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smugglers worked as if for their lives;
two, by means of a long rope, hauling the kegs
from the cave to the adit, whilst the other five
carried them to the furzebrake on the hillside
and hid them amongst the bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
The continual passing to and fro of the men
cheered the hare in his niche, for it served to
alarm the stoats and keep them at a distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had the last of the kegs been hidden
away when one of the smugglers, he who had cried
out in his sleep, gave a false alarm, causing the
others to rush to the adit, where one after the
other they slid down the rope to the cave, all
except the sentry, whose duty it was to haul up
the line and stow it away. An old hand at the
trade and a man of iron nerve, he proceeded to
coil the rope in the most leisurely way before
he came out of the adit, bringing the rope on
his arm. He thought he was alone, but he
was not; the hare kept as close to his heels
as a dog, while the stoats followed at a short
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dark though it was, the smuggler held along
the brink of the cliff till compelled to swerve by a
great pile of rocks that looked against the murky
sky like a black wall. By and by as he skirted it
he stopped and, shifting the rope to his left arm,
began feeling the face of the rock with his right.
He was searching for the rude steps by which
he would reach the summit of the carn to hide
the rope, the hare meanwhile remaining so close
to his feet that once it actually grazed his sea-boots
with its soft side. Presently he found
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
the place and began the ascent, thus leaving the
hare to the mercy of the stoats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the smuggler had climbed four feet
the hare realised his danger. At once he fled
along the edge of the cliff, the stoats, who had
already begun to creep towards him, in hot
pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst he was free from the numbing sensation
of fear, which had subsided in the friendly
presence of man, his relentless persecutors even
at their utmost speed seemed almost motionless
behind him, but the moment it returned, cramping
his powers, he lost ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he began to look anxiously about
him to find a refuge, as in that lay now his only
hope of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sea from half a score caverns bellowed
its invitation, but he heeded it not. Only in
the last resort would he cast himself over
the cliff, so in weariness and fear he struggled
on with the terrorising cry of the pack ever in
his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before him lay a small and oddly shaped
headland, so narrow at its base that any animal
seeking the coast beyond was certain to cross
the neck and avoid going round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so the hare. As if fearful of losing
touch of the cliff, he took no notice of the short
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
cut, but held on round the promontory till, near
the extreme point, he struck and followed a
track laid by foxes—a treacherous track, that
after winding in and out between overhanging
rocks and the lip of the cliff, suddenly ended
on the brink of a precipice. He saw the predicament
he was in shortly after rounding the
point, and despair gripped his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he had almost given himself up
for lost, a shelf of rock that projected over the
track offered asylum if only he could reach it.
Once, twice he gathered his limbs, only to
recoil from launching himself at the leap, for he
felt that it was more than he could compass.
Then he listened to the swelling cry; that
warned him he had not a moment to lose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Animals, like men, when face to face with
death, perform feats seemingly beyond their
powers. Thus it was with the hare, into whose
mad spring was concentrated all the force that
love of life could rouse. But his greatest efforts
merely enabled him to get such a grip of the
rock as prevented him from falling back.
Frantic was his struggle to complete a lodgment
by dragging his hind legs to the shelf. He
succeeded just in time to squat as the first
of the stoats<a id='stoat3'></a> came galloping round the point
and pulled up at the spot where the trail
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
suddenly ended. In a twinkling the rest of
the band followed, and recognising the situation,
looked to the leader for guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No time was lost. Some went to the end of
the track and stood gazing at the depths below,
but the greater number followed the leader over
the brink of the precipice, abreast of the ledge.
The daring creatures seemed to be courting
destruction in attempting the descent; their claw-grip
and marvellous agility, however, took them
safely down places that might have been thought
to deny foothold, and all reached the undercliff
without mishap. Now they stood at the edge of
the tide, where from every point of vantage,
even from the crown of the streaming rocks,
they scanned the white water, appearing to
imagine that the hare had leapt into the surf
and was to be seen there if only their eyes
could detect her. Nothing met their gaze
except a splintered bowsprit, and by and by, after
extending their search beyond the point, they
climbed the cliff again, rejoining the others
where they stood beneath the ledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation of the starving creatures was
a desperate one, and for a moment the leader
was as completely at a loss what to do as the
rest of the pack. Suddenly it occurred to her
that the hare might have returned on his
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
trail, have leapt aside and made off inland;
the next instant she sprang over the backs of
the stoats surrounding her, to return to the
extreme point. That was the spot from which
she conjectured he would make his leap, and
on reaching it she searched the ground near it
for traces of his scent. Nose to ground she
tried rocks, fern, cushions of sea-pinks, even
the heather covering the highest part of the
headland, before going back to a spot near
the point where she happened to be on a level
with the shelf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the moon lit up the scene,
silvering the sea, revealing the narrow track and
the pack clustered there with heads directed to
their leader. Her attitude tells them something
has excited her curiosity. Her eyes are scrutinising
the strange object on the ledge, and though it
lies completely shadowed by another ledge above,
she presently recognises the hare, and in some
way communicates her discovery to her followers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon they strive to reach the shelf,
some by the overhanging wall, the rest by leaping;
but all their efforts are in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the leader has succeeded in gaining
the higher ledge, from which by craning
her neck she is able to see the hare beneath,
who indeed is within a few feet of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
The upper shelf is semicircular, and point
after point of its circumference she examines in
the hope of being able to get at her prey.
Soon she discovers a notch. From this, twisting
her lissom body, she tries to leap to the
lower shelf, only to fail, and narrowly escape
falling over the precipice. She is soon back
for another attempt. Once and again she is
near succeeding. Had the indent been a little
deeper, had the under ledge projected but another
inch, had it only been a little lower, she must
have flung herself on to it; but as it stood, it
was beyond her skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her resources, however, were not exhausted.
Resting her fore feet on the edge of the shelf,
every toe extended and every claw gripping the
rock, she lowered her long white body and
swung it to and fro like a ghostly pendulum.
Now this way, now that, it oscillated, till presently
at the full extent of her inward swing
she let go—falling on her back within a few
inches of the hare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he showed the wonderful grit that was
in him. As she fell he rose, lashed out with
his powerful hind legs and sent her flying by a
kick that drove her over the edge, down, down,
down to the raging waters far below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loss of their leader discouraged the rest
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
of the pack. As if in distress, they kept darting
up and down the track till a deluge of rain drove
them off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hare was left master of the field. His
flank rose and fell more quickly than its wont,
the pupils of his eyes were distended as never
before, but already he was planning his escape,
and had chosen the retreat he would make for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hours of blinding rain followed, lightning
occasionally lit up the blackness shrouding cliff
and sea; it was no weather for any living thing
to be abroad in, and indeed nothing appeared till
near dawn, when a bedraggled white creature
made her way with difficulty up the face of
the cliff and staggered to the track. It was
the leader of the stoats, who after struggling
with the backwash which had nearly buffeted
the life out of her, had managed to land, and
after a long rest, come back for her followers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awhile she stood beneath the ledge and
looked up. Too feeble to do more, she meant
to return at dusk to pit her wit against the
hare’s, in some way to get at him, drive her
fangs into his great vein and drink deep of
his blood: she was even thinking of the feast
in prospect as she crawled away on the trail of
the pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was, however, reckoning without her
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
host. In as wild a dawn as ever broke upon
the Land’s End, the hare leapt from his sanctuary
and stole over the rain-lashed moor to
<a id='chap10'></a>Chapel Carn Brea, where, happy in the thought
that the downpour would destroy all trace
of his trail, he fell soundly asleep, nor even
dreamt of the terrible ordeal through which he
had passed.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span><h1><a id='c11'></a>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'><span class='it'>L’HOMME S’AMUSE</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As if to compensate the persecuted animal for
his recent trials, the hare now enjoyed what
was to him a long immunity from molestation,
for during January and part of February no
enemy waylaid or pursued him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of that time the weather, which
had again become bleak and inclement, suddenly
softened with the return of the westerly wind,
becoming so mild as to savour of spring. The
change was felt and responded to by every
creature. On St Valentine’s Day when <a id='gold3'></a>Golden
Valley resounded with the love songs of birds,
the hare had already set out in search of a mate.
Whether influenced by reason or by instinct, he
did not seek her along his usual beats, on which
he had not once crossed the trail of his kind, but
set his face to the north, to the unexplored land
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
he had often looked down on from Bartinney and
Chapel Carn Brea; there he was in high hope
of meeting her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So intent was he on his quest that he never
stopped to browse, leaving untouched patch
after patch of tender herbage in the moorland
farms he crossed. Yet he never saw a living
thing. He came to the wild which is crowned
by the weird rocks of Carn Kenidzhek, and
here, standing near the summit, he scrutinised
the moonlit waste, apparently a desolate land,
a land without life. Just before daybreak, however,
there came into view, ghostly as the
stoats but very much larger, a creature threading
its way in and out among the furze bushes
as it made for the Carn. The hare was
puzzled as to its identity until it began to
ascend the slope, when to his surprise he
saw that it was that uncommon thing, a white
<a id='badger4'></a>badger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It presently winded the hare, stood, gazed at
him, then after a glance at the faint glow in
the depressions between the hills, hurried to
its earth. As soon as it had disappeared the
hare sought a couch in the heather, and sat
with his face to the far-off Carns, whose crests
were soon bright in the rays of the rising
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
“In that golden land,” he thought, “I
shall surely find her. To-night I will go there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day proved as glorious as the night
had been serene, but for the hare it was all
too long. He could hardly sit in his form, so
eager was he to be afoot, and the moment the
stars peeped he quitted the seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What miles on miles he traversed: he visited
the hills, he penetrated to the cliffs of <a id='morv'></a>Morvah,
he turned inland again and roamed wide
stretches of moor and down, he skirted Chun<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a>
cromlech, and passed within sight of the
Men Scryfa as he headed for the <a id='galv'></a>Galver, with
its upthrust peak conspicuous against the stars.
From the Galver he went to Hannibal’s Carn,
and presently stood on its highest rock
gazing at the plain beneath. His ears were
pricked as they had been a score times since
sundown to catch the whispers of the waste
and perhaps hear the bleat of a doe. He
listened as he had never listened before; but
there came no call, no sound indeed save the
murmur of the dawn wind about the crags;
so at last the love-sick fellow forsook his station
and returned to the Galver, where after weaving
a maze of trails he sought a form high up
the slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
In his lone retreat he felt as safe as on
Chapel Carn Brea; he was even more remote
from the haunts of man. Yet <a id='harr'></a>harriers were
already on their way to the meet, and it was
that very ground where he sat that was to be
hunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Squire of Trengwainton<a id='treng'></a> had breakfasted
by candlelight, and as the clock over the stables
was striking half-past six, he mounted his
favourite grey mare and started out attired
in full hunting costume, green coat, white
breeches, boots reaching almost to the knee, and
a velvet cap that well became his clean-shaven
face. Twelve couple of hounds followed at
his horse’s heels, the little procession as it
made its way along the avenue of beeches
being closed by Sam Noy, the whipper-in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming to the high ground beyond the Forest
Carn where the track forks, the squire turned
in his saddle and asked which road he should
take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lower road, Sir Tudor,” was the prompt
reply. Strange though it seems that the Squire
of Trengwainton should ask his way to the
meet, the explanation is simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had arrived in Cornwall from Pembroke
only three weeks earlier, after a voyage exciting
even for those disturbed times. The schooner in
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
which he sailed was attacked off the <a id='end3'></a>Land’s
End by a privateer which had been harassing
St Ives, and compelled to run before the wind
in order to escape capture. Under cover of
darkness she got away, and reached <a id='ives'></a>St Ives
with no more damage than a hole in her
mainsail and the loss of her topmast. But
the mayor and the watch mistaking the rakish-looking
craft for another Frenchman, had
opened fire from the three four-pounders on
the “Island”—luckily without effect, the balls
dropping at least fifty yards short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident had so greatly amused the squire
that the very memory of it brought a smile to
his face again and again as he rode through
the grey dawn. By and by the sun rose,
making a jewel of every dewdrop, and calling
forth the carols of the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This changed the train of his thoughts. His
mind reverted to Gaston de Foix, of all followers
of the chase the one dearest to his heart, and
after passing the farmhouse at Lanyon as he
descended the hill to the millpool he was quoting
aloud: “Et quant le soleil sera levé, il
verra celle douce rosée sur rincelles et herbettes
et le soleil par sa vertu les fera reluysir. C’est
grant plaisance et joye au cœur du veneur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We turn in here, sir,” presently interposed
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
the whipper-in, who thought the squire had taken
leave of his seven senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four Parishes, where the meet is, lies right
afore ’ee under the Galver, and the Galver is
that git hill up again’ the sky theere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Sir Tudor left the track for
the moor lined with the shadows of the
Carns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awaiting him at Four Parishes<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> were Squire
Tregenna, to whose gun-fire he had been exposed
in St Ives Bay, Squire Praed of Trevethoe,
a few yeomen, some crofters for the most part
fairly mounted, and a promiscuous crowd of men
afoot, amongst whom the fiddler’s pinched face
peeped out between the rough beards of two
tall smugglers, and three or four ne’er-do-wells
were marked off by their careless slouch from
the sturdier forms of half a dozen miners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After greetings had been exchanged, Sir
Tudor appealed to Jim Curnow of Towednack,
whose keenness and knowledge he had already
noticed: “Where shall we draw first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try the ground about the Galver,” said
Curnow, “if there’s a hare left in the country
she’ll be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was decided; and all moved off to the
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
hill, where the pack scattered freely in search
of the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were a level lot of hounds, very much
alike to a stranger, yet as different in the eyes of
the squire as were their names to his ears. He
had named them himself, most happily Squire
Praed thought, on hearing Sir Tudor call in
turn on Melody, Corisande, Guinevere, Merlin,
Cymro, and Caradoc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awhile each hound worked separately, indifferent
to all around, one would have thought,
yet in reality keenly observant of the others,
for as soon as Trueboy waved his stern half
a score flocked to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are at once all excitement, as well they
may be; they have hit the line of the hare, and
are following it between the two big boulders
where he passed on his way to <a id='hann'></a>Hannibal’s
Carn, the tan splashes on their coats gleaming
like russet gold in the slant sunlight, their
musical voices awakening the echoes of the rocks,
and thrilling every member of the little field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they return to the Galver, clinging
tenaciously to the trail, whose bewildering maze
they strive their utmost to unravel. The eager
movements of every hound show that he knows
the hare is near and will soon be afoot, yet,
when like a shadow gliding over the sunlit slope
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
below the ridge he silently steals away, not
one even suspects that he has risen, much less
catches a glimpse of his crouching form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squire, however, has viewed him; his
hand proclaims it, raised to command silence
and allow a reasonable start to the jack, who
still moves stealthily in the hope of getting away
unobserved. But the moment the squire cheers
the hounds on to his line he knows that he
has been seen, instantly abandons his slinking
tactics and breaks into a gallop, his head
pointed straight for his native hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an exhilarating moment for Sir Tudor,
and as he settled down to ride, what with the
pleasant undulations of his horse, what with the
freshness of the morning and the wildness of
the country, above all with the thought that
his little companions in a hundred hunts were
chiming on the scent of their first Cornish
hare, he would not have changed seats with King
George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept sufficiently close to the pack to
observe the niceties of the chase and help the
hounds in case of a check; but they held on,
straight as a crow might fly, in the direction of
Chun Castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There the hare stopped for the first time
and looked back. His glance, which took in
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
hounds, horsemen, and the straggling line of
pedestrians, removed all doubts that he himself
was the object of pursuit, so he laid his ears back
again and resumed his gallop, scared nearly as
much by the glaring sunlight as by the cries
of the pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice he swerved, the first time to cross
a ploughed field which he knew would hold little
scent, and again to thread his way among the
cattle in a field beyond. Presently he crossed
the track to St Just close behind a train of
mules bearing tin ore, set foot on Balleswidden
common, and soon saw the hills of his first home
right ahead of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cheered by the sight he sped bravely on
across the waste of furze and heather to the
foothills, and bounded up the slope with a
vigour that showed little sign of fatigue. He
was making for the form. There he believed
he would be safe when shielded by a ruse, for
he meant after going nearly to the foot of
Chapel Carn Brea to return on his line and
leap aside into his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind was full of his purpose as he skirted
the <a id='lidd3'></a>Liddens, and a little way beyond them he
stopped to satisfy himself that he had time to
carry out his plan before the hounds came up.
Though he listened intently, he heard nothing; his
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
pursuers had been delayed in the ploughed
field as he expected: he had ample opportunity
for his manœuvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the whole plan came to nought. On
reaching the chantry he suddenly leapt aside
as if from an ambuscade, for he found himself
in the presence of man. There on a rock
sat an <a id='antiq'></a>antiquary sketching the ruin, and so
engrossed by his task that he never saw the
hare. Even if he had he would not have
raised a finger to scare it, much less betray
its refuge to the hounds. But the hare’s faith
in man was gone. He fled down the hill
towards Brea Farm, save for the thud of the
<a id='flail'></a>flail in the barn silent as in winter, and from
thence to the moor, over which he rather loped
than galloped, for he was getting exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Sir Tudor had reached the
chantry. Despite the excitement of the chase
he reined in his mare, and looked for the first
time on Cornwall’s fairest scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine subject for a canvas,” he said, addressing
the antiquary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not half so impressive as this old
oratory, with its memories.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are right,” said the squire,
riding on again after the hounds, now streaming
over the boundary wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
The mare took him over the wall with the
greatest ease, and soon was cantering along the
bridle-track, watched by Andrew, whom the music
of the hounds had drawn to the barn steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen her?” asked Sir Tudor,
when he reached the farmyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seed what, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, theere ed’n such a crittur in the
country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later the fiddler came running past. “Where
are they, Andrew?” he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone right over the ‘curley’ moor straight
for Hayl Kimbra Pool. But what’s the hurry?
Stop and have a bit of croust,<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> a bit o’ heavy
cake.”<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor’ bless the boy, ’tes no time for feasting
nor fiddling. Did ’ee ever hear such pretty
music as they little dogs give out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And without waiting for an answer the <a id='fid2'></a>fiddler
went off as if his life depended on being in at
the finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='andrew3'></a>Andrew had directed him well, for the hare
had gone to the pool where he had his first
swim. The hounds following, crossed it as if
nothing could live before them; but on the far
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
side of the moor, where beyond Trevescan it
slopes gently to the sea, they were in difficulties.
The hare had run along a stone wall, returned
a score yards on his trail, leapt into the track
it bordered, and gone off in the direction of his
cliff retreat, now his goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There for the first time the squire came to
their aid. He solved the mystery of the wall
in vain, for the track held no scent, and he was
face to face with defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing a shout, he looked up and saw a
man on a bank waving his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see her, my man?” said he, riding
up to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, sir, and flinged this pollack at her,
and turned her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she done up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit, for when I heaved the fish, she
took down along over they rocks there, like a
ball of fire. But if you’re going down to the
point, you’d better leave hoss and hounds behind.
’Tes no place for they.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the hint, Sir Tudor left his mare
and the hounds in charge of the whipper-in, and
casting his eyes right and left as he went in
the hope of seeing the hare, made his way to
the extremity of the headland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call this point?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
“Why, bless thee, I thought every grown
man knowed that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tes the <a id='end4'></a>Land’s End.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” ejaculated Sir Tudor reflectively.
He was moved at learning that he stood at
the uttermost verge of the land; for a moment
he forgot all about the hare, but only for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she’s not gone over,” said he, as
he looked down at the seething waters. Then
after a pause, he added with much feeling—“She
was as stout a hare as ever stood before
hounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quite believed that the jack had leaped
over rather than be taken; but he was wrong.
The distressed creature had found a sanctuary
amongst the rocks, where the hounds would never
have found him even had they been allowed to
search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There we will leave him, for though his after
years were marked by hairbreadth escapes, his
adventures do not exceed in interest those that
have been chronicled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One incident, however, must be mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within four days of the chase he returned
to <a id='hann2'></a>Hannibal’s Carn, where he found a mate
worthy of his fine qualities, and for a time his
happiness was complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
All his days he remained true to his native
hill; in the end he crept beneath the ruins of the
chantry, and there the <a id='toad2'></a>toad guarded the portal
of his death-chamber.</p>
